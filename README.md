# An analysis of the influence of Black Southern Churches on the Southern Black Community

## Background:

Documenting the American South is one of the longest running digital publishing initiatives at the University of North Carolina. It was designed to give researchers digital access to some of the libraryâ€™s unique collections in the form of high quality page scans as well as structured, corrected and machine readable text. (https://docsouth.unc.edu/docsouthdata/)

## Goal: 

Analyze rhetoric of the Black Southern Church in the American South and it's effects on documents written by self emancipated and previously enslaved Black people.

## Research question:

Are there any measurable similarities between the themes of documents from Southern Black churches and the documents from self-emancipated and freed Black people? 

## Approach:

[Documenting The American South](https://docsouth.unc.edu/) is one of the longest running efforts by the University of North Carolina to collect, digitize, and publish documents from self-emancipated and freed Black people. Using [DocSouth Data](https://docsouth.unc.edu/docsouthdata/) and data from the [Religious Text Content Guide](https://docsouth.unc.edu/neh/religiouscontent.html), analyze the correlation between autobiographies, biographies, church documents, sermons, histories, encyclopedias, and other published materials from Southern Black churches and the narratives of slaves in regards to religion.

Proposed analysis:

- Evaluate language of both data sets
- Evaluate themes of both data sets
- Using data from the [Religious Text Content Guide](https://docsouth.unc.edu/neh/religiouscontent.html), develop a theme predictor for texts
- Evaluate how much (if any) thematic overlap there is between religious texts and slave narratives
