    slavery is dissolved. The slave's wife is his, only at the will of her master, who may violate her chastity with impunity: It is my candid opinion that one of the strongest motives which operate upon the slaveholders, and induce them to retain their iron grasp upon the unfortunate slave, is because it gives them such unlimited control in this respect over the female slaves. The greater part of slaveholders are licentious men, and the most respectable and the kindest of masters, keep some of their slaves as mistresses. It is for their pecuniary interest to do so in several respects. Their progeny is so many dollars and cents in their pockets, instead of being a bill of expense to them, as would be the case if their slaves were free; and mulatto slaves command a higher price than dark colored ones; but it is too horrid a subject to describe. Suffice it to say, that no slave has the least certainty of being able to retain his wife or her husband a single hour; so that the slave is placed under strong inducements not to form a union of  love,  for he knows not how soon the chords wound around his heart would be snapped asunder, by the hand of the brutal slave-dealer. Northern people sustain slavery, knowing that it is a system of perfect licentiousness, and yet go to church and boast of their purity and holiness!            On this plantation, the slaves were never allowed to attend church, but managed their religious affairs in their own way. An old slave, whom they called Uncle John, decided upon their piety, and would baptize them during the silent watches of the night, while their master was  taking his rest in sleep.  Thus is the slave under the necessity of even  saving his soul  in the hours when the eye of his master, who          usurps the place of God over him, is turned from him. Think of it, ye who contend for the necessity of these rites, to constitute a man a Christian! By night must the poor slave steal away from his bed of straw, and leaving his miserable hovel, must drag his weary limbs to some adjacent stream of water, where a fellow slave, as ignorant as himself, proceeds to administer the ordinance of baptism; and as he plunges his comrades into the water, in imitation of the Baptist of old, how he trembles, lest the footsteps of his master should be heard, advancing to their Bethesda,--knowing that if such should be the case, the severe punishment that awaits them all. Baptists, are ye striking hands with Southern churches, which thus exclude so many slaves from the  waters of salvation?             But we were obliged to cut short our conversation with these slaves, by beholding the approach of the overseer, who was directing his steps towards us, like a bear seeking its prey. We had only time to ask this man,  if they were often whipped?  to which he replied,  that not a day passed over their heads, without some of their number being brutally punished;  and,  said he,  we shall have to suffer for this talk with you.  He then told us, that many of them had been severely whipped that very morning, for having been baptized the night before. After we left them, we looked back, and heard the screams of these poor creatures, suffering under the blows of the hard-hearted overseer, for the crime of talking with us;--which screams sounded in our ears for some time. We felt thankful that we were exempted from such terrible treatment; but still, we knew not how soon we should be subject to the same cruel fate. By this time we      
               Haskell, the overseer, experienced religion about this time, and joined the Duncards, a religious sect located  at the Southwest, who baptise by immersion, dipping  their converts three times. The overseer being an  unprincipled scamp, noted for his drinking propensities,  and for cheating all with whom he dealt, a large number  of persons assembled to witness the baptismal  ceremony performed on the negro-driver. Some of the  blacks are very superstitious, and are of opinion that  the Lord will answer their prayers, in any case when  they ask for the extermination of bad men. So, the  day that the overseer was led to the pond to have his  sins washed out, not less than nine of the oldest slaves went on their knees, and prayed that the cruel  negro-driver might not come out of the water alive. Among  the crowd that had come together was old Peter Swite,  who kept a dram shop, and who complained that  Haskell owed him several dollars for drink, but which the  overseer denied. As John Mason, the minister, pulled  the negro-driver up, after dipping him the third time,  old Peter took his pipe from his mouth, and cried out,  at the top of his voice,   Douce  him again, John!  He's a dirty dog; I know him well; he never pays  his debts.  So the minister, either forgetting himself, or really thinking his new convert needed the fourth  dip, put the sinner once more under the water. This  last plunge came near drowning him, for the man of  God was much exhausted, and was scarcely able to lift  the negro-driver out of the water, and the latter had  taken two or three hearty drinks before he was drawn  to the surface. Although the prayers of the slaves           were not answered, they nevertheless took great credit to themselves for the misstep of the minister. That night, the slaves on the whole plantation were in the highest glee. The opossums that had been lying in the frost were taken down and baked with sweet potatoes,  and every voice ascended to God, either in prayer or in song, for the half success of their prayers at the baptism.        
      herself entirely alone, she fell on her knees, and in broken accents, poured out her soul to God, pleading, as well as she knew how, for mercy and forgiveness.             On rising, she was startled by the voice of her master, who, having suspected that something new was going on, had seated himself in his parlour to watch the movements.  O!  (said Chloe, when relating the story,)  my heart up in my mouth. I di'n know what to do, what I hab to suffer. But I went in de parlour, 'cause he call me. He say, 'Chloe, dis week, you go Mr S. de minister, and ask him baptize you.' I frighten! I say, O massa, I poor creature, I no fit for baptize. 'Yes,' he say, 'any body pray as you hab, is fit.' I 'fraid say much,           fear he angry, so, soon I could, I go up my chamber; den I tink, what all dis mean? Same man tell me once, I should no learn read, if I do, I tie up by my two thumb, and whipp'd; same man now tell me go be baptize! What all dis  mean?               Thus unexpectedly brought into a strait, poor Chloe was greatly distressed. When her master called her, she supposed he intended to correct her. That he should, at once, tell her to ask for  baptism,  was so wide an extreme, she was equally alarmed. Conscious that she was not, agreeably to the views she now entertained of the necessity  of regeneration, a suitable subject, she trembled at the idea. But not daring to disobey her master, she complied with his order, and           was sprinkled after the mode of infant baptism. This afforded no relief to her troubled conscience; she became more distressed on account of sin; her   heart more sick;   particularly on hearing a sermon on the  unpardonable  sin.             In this state of mind, she resorted to her kind friend, Mr A. who endeavoured to console her feelings by instructing her, that although she was a great sinner, and nothing but the blood of Christ could cleanse her, yet owing to her ignorance of religious subjects, he thought she could not have committed  that sin , and therefore there was hope that she might receive forgiveness, if she truly repented, and came to the Saviour in his own appointed way. Her  mind grew more calm, but she     
      to bind all that called upon the name of the Lord, and bring them to Jerusalem for punishment, and afterwards became most zealous in preaching Christ and Him crucified.            My eldest brother, one of the most pious men that ever lived, without being a christian, when he used to hear me swear so hard, tried to persuade me to better things. So when he stood outside and heard me talk, he just found out that he was a sinner.            I was baptized at Norman Eye Ferry, together with about fifty others, most of my comrades, in the month of December, when the water was very cold.            I, as an individual, make no difference whether a man is immersed, sprinkled or dipped. I believe true baptism is of the Holy Ghost. It is argued that John baptized Christ in the river Jordan. I am told by historians that river is only about two and a half feet deep. Now I should like for any man to answer this question: Is it true that Christ went down into this water and came up out of it? Did John immerse, sprinkle or pour water on Him? Please answer that question. That will settle all difficulties. Now I say  ye must be born of the Spirit and of the Holy Ghost,  before you can enter into the kingdom of Heaven. What is the meaning of John's baptizing in the wilderness? for we must acknowledge there was no river nor ponds there. We think he must have either sprinkled or poured. So, in the           case of the eunuch, there is no positive statement given, whether she was sprinkled, dipped or poured upon. In my judgment it is useless to argue these points, as there is no positive proof.            I take up the Saviour's argument,  ye must be born again,  and if a man never saw water, his way is clear. For there is only one church, namely, the Church of Jesus Christ. Those taking the opposite view please answer these questions.            Now I come to reflection, I am about to fulfill the promised made a year or two ago. When I knew I was to make a trip to Baltimore, with a load of grain, my mind was made up. I went around and paid up all my debts. I never let any mortal know what I intended doing. When we loaded with the grain, I said  good bye  to the land of bondage, I am now about to sail for the  land of the free and the home of the brave.  Our little vessel wafted over the deep blue waves, until she reached the shores of Maryland, where I had landed many a cargo before, both of grain and timber. But I said in a still small voice, this is the last cargo I shall ever land from the schooner Susan Ellen. No one knew the secret save Him, who said,  let there be light, and there was light.  Freedom's land I was bound to see. We arrived in Baltimore safe with the vessel and cargo. I had a new hawser on board, and I tied her up with three strands double. She never would have got from the wharf till the hawser rotted.      
     But now I thought that if my master would only come to Jesus he could be saved. I began to pray for the white people, and to tell all around what a dear Salvation I had found.      SPIRITUAL FREEDOM.              Free indeed,  John viii., 36. I had now a free soul. But my poor mother, who had taught me the Lord's Prayer and for years been so anxious that I should  seek religion,  had never herself understood the finished work of Christ. She now, however, accepted Him as her own Saviour, and gave herself to the Lord in glad and full surrender. I was anxious, after my conversion, to unite with the Baptist Church. In Richmond there were Churches of coloured people, but they had white Pastors, who never failed to keep us informed about Abraham's servants, and as to the injunction to Hagar. I could not join any Church unless I had a  pass  from my master. I went to him and asked permission to be baptised. He at once said:  No, you shall not unite with the Baptist Church.  Mr. Brown, my spiritual adviser, told me to go to the Lord, and say,  Lord, if Thou hast ever done anything for my never-dying soul, please manifest Thyself to me in moving the master to give me a pass to be baptised.  I think it was nearly three months before I again ventured to ask him. But when I summoned up enough courage to ask him the second time, he at once gave permission. This was a manifest answer to prayer. When the appointed Sabbath for baptism arrived, my mother and I  went down into the water  hand-in-hand, and were baptised, rejoicing in the privilege of following our Divine Master, and when we  came up out of the water  we  went on our way rejoicing.              Soon after my conversion I felt a deep desire to preach the Gospel. But two difficulties presented themselves: first, I was a slave, for though I had a free soul, yet my body was in slavery; then, second, I could not read the     
   commenced a protracted meeting. Shortly after the commencement of the meeting I professed faith in Christ. Oh how well I remember the time when Jesus freed me! Then, after I had found Christ, I had to go to Old Mass and Old Miss to get permission to join the Church. They consented, and then came the time to be baptized. It was extremely cold, and the streams covered with ice an inch thick. I had to again ask permission to be baptized, and with tears in their eyes my request was granted. Rev. Wells buried about fifty souls that day in the liquid grave. Thank God that I was saved!           There was something on Robinson place that was an exception to the general rule. There were forty-two in family, and all members of the Church who were above ten years of age, and all Baptists save one old colored lady, Robinson himself having been a deacon in the Baptist Church for about forty years. After my conversion and baptism I was permitted to attend Sunday-school and study the Word of God for myself. My master then removed all objections to my learning how to read, and said he wanted all the boys to learn how to read the Bible, it being against the laws of the State to write. We had to steal that portion of our education, and I did my share of it I suppose. Only a few of the white people would let their slaves attend the Sunday-school, hence I became an active member in it.     
   had an important influence on then conduct in after life.           After this, he was bound to Edmund Daily to learn the House joinery business, and during his apprenticeship, he felt that his sins were pardoned--that God loved him and would keep him from temptation. He then wished to ascertain how far the other party to the covenant had persevered in his religious career, but, alas for human nature, he had forgotten his promise, and yet remained a sinner out of the fold of God, and when Ferrill talked to him on the subject, tears coursed down his checks, and but a few weeks elapsed before he and his wife were buried with Christ in Baptism. He sent for him to witness the ceremony, and at the same time Ferrill related his religious experience to Rev. Absalom Waller, and was himself baptised which important event occurred when he was twenty years of age. After his baptism he felt himself called to preach the Gospel but was disobedient to the Heavenly Order. Shortly after this he attended a prayer meeting, where the new converts, Elders and members were assembled. After singing and praying for some time, he was called on to sing. With many misgivings and a palpitating heart he rose, requested an Elder if he should make a mistake to correct him and proceeded to sing,  Alas, and did my Savior bleed, and did my sovereign die.            After singing, he was called on to pray, and the first thing he knew after kneeling down, he was standing up, relating his religious experience, and felt the love of God shed abroad in his heart as much as when he was first converted. He heard no sound, but in his soul he felt, that the command bound him to go and preach the gospel to every creature, and he said,  Thy will be done.  The whole house was one sea of commotion, and all seemed rejoicing in the Lord, shaking hands and evincing by their every look, the presence of the Spirit of Grace shed abroad in their hearts. He attended two more meetings of a similar character, and, at the last one, he hid himself away in the corner, as he had some suspicion that they wished to exalt him to some position, which perhaps he could not fill with       honor to himself, and what was and is far more  imimportant  with honor to his God. When all the others had finished singing and praying, an enquiry was made if he was in the house, when he was brought out from his place of concealment and told to sing, pray, exhort, or preach, or whatever the Spirit of the Lord prompted him to do, and this Scripture came into his mind:  I can do all things, the Lord helping me.  He spoke from these words about twenty-five minutes, then the meeting was dismissed. They told him to remain after the congregation had retired. They placed a chair and he sat down in it, and they propounded various questions, which were answered satisfactorily. They then put their hands on his head and prayed God's blessing up on him in all after life. After this they arose from their knees and gave him the right hand of fellowship, and said  we give you up to go and preach the gospel wherever the Lord may cast your lot and the doors open for you.            He commenced preaching, and the people appeared to receive the word gladly, and when he had gained about fifty converts who were ready to be baptised which ceremony he was not authorised to perform by the Virginia law, he procured the services of Preacher Bowles, and he baptised them. The white people frequently invited Ferrill to their houses to sing for them, as he was considered a great singer, and was sent for, far and near, to preach funeral sermons when the servants would die. On one occasion he went twenty-four miles to Bears Island to preach a funeral sermon. The servants met him at the gate and warned him not to go in, as the overseer, Neill Barnett, had threatened to beat him if he preached on his premises.           The prospect was not very flattering and he even faltered, but thinking of what the Apostles had suffered, he concluded to proceed, let the consequences be what they might. After singing and and praying, he looked out and saw the overseer with two other men, coming toward him, all three armed with clubs and cow hides. The reader may fancy his feelings at this time, and he assures us, that they were of a most unpleasant character. However he commenced his discourse from    
     be increased.  The Redeemer  shall see of the travail of his soul, and be satisfied,  in beholding the gathering together, not only of the outcasts of Israel, that are ready to perish; but of churches and people from all the tongues, and kindreds, and nations of the earth. In the day of his appearing, the sons of Africa will vie with their brethren of the North, and the West, and the East, in resounding the praises of God their Saviour, from one end of the earth to the other.             In the meantime, we rejoice in every occasional instance of the love and power of God in effecting the conversation of some, who appear as the first fruits of that harvest which shall hereafter so fruitfully grow up, to the honour of Christ and the blessedness of his redeemed people.             The following narrative of real facts may, perhaps, illustrate the importance of the foregoing remarks.             During a residence of some years continuance, in the neighbourhood of the sea, an Officer in the navy called upon me, and stated, that he had just taken a lodging in the parish for his wife and children; and had a Negro, who had been three years in his service.  The lad is a deserving fellow,  said the Officer,  and he has a great desire          to be baptized; I have promised him to ask you to do it if you have not any objections.               Does he know any thing,  I replied,  of the principles of the Christian religion?               O yes, I am sure he does,  answered the Captain;  for he talks a deal about it in the kitchen, and often gets laughed at for his pains; but he takes it all very patiently.               Does he behave well as your servant?               Yes, that he does: he is as honest and civil a fellow as ever came aboard a ship, or lived in a house.               Was he always so well behaved?              No,  said the Officer;  when I first had him, he was often very unruly and deceitful; but for the last two years he has been quite like another creature.               Well, sir, I shall be very glad to see him, and think it probable I shall wish to go through a course of instruction and examination; during which I shall be able to form a judgment how far it will be right to admit him to the sacrament of baptism. Can he read?               Yes,  replied his master;  he has been taking great pains to learn to read for some time          speaks English better than many of his countrymen, but you will find it a little broken. When will it be convenient that I should send him over to you?               To-morrow afternoon, Sir, if you please.               He shall come to you about four o'clock, and you shall see what you can make of him.              With this promise he took his leave. I felt glad of an opportunity of instructing a native of that land whose wrongs and injuries had often caused me to sigh and mourn: the more so, when I reflected  who  had been the aggressors.             At the appointed hour, my negro disciple arrived. He was a very young looking man, with a sensible, lively, and pleasing countenance.             I desired him to sit down, and said,  your master informs me that you wish to have some conversation with me respecting Christian baptism.               Yes, Sir, me very much wish to be a Christian,  said he.              Why do you wish so?               Because me know that Christian go to heaven when he die.               How long have you had that wish?  I said.              Ever since me hear one goot minister preach      
   and I consented to embrace the Greek faith, the State religion of Russia.           I was baptized in Riga on the 12th of November, 1855, leaving my Mohammedan name of  Mohammed Ali Ben Said  at the font, and bearing therefrom the Christian name of Nicholas. This performance ended, I thought the job was complete, but the next day the  papa,  or priest who had me baptized, sent for me, and on getting where he was, I found myself in a beautiful chapel, handsomely paved with marble of different colors. He caused me to kneel before an immense  tableau  of the Saviour for hours, asking pardons for my past sins.           As the marble was harder than my knees, I was in perfect agony during the greater portion of the time, and became so enraged with the  papa,  that I fear I committed more sins during that space of time than I had done in days before.    
     mind:-- Here have I been praying to Jesus, whom I have never served, and have never thought of praying to the Devil, whom I have always served.  This was a new revelation. He saw it was unreasonable to expect help from a Being whose service he had not entered. He saw that repentance and reformation of life were the first steps for him to take. Thus put upon the right path by the Infinite Spirit working with his spirit, he soon found the help and peace that he sought.             After a suitable lapse of time, he applied to Col. Suttle, according to custom, for leave to be baptized; no slave being suffered to comply with that command of the Saviour or admitted to the church without a written permission from his owner. To Anthony's request, Col. Suttle, irritated by the prospect of loss from the maimed hand, returned a rough refusal, and even added words to wound the spirit of the young convert. If he joined the church, Suttle said, he would soon be drinking or following the women, like others. Anthony turned away with a heavy heart, but still with a silent resolve to pray that God would yet incline his owner to grant his request. The prayer was answered. Returning some time after from Foote's, where he had again resumed his labor in the mill, he unexpectedly met his owner in a carriage, on his way to the Springs. The latter kindly saluted him, and now of his own accord gave the requisite permission for baptism. Emboldened by such rare favor, Anthony petitioned for money to buy clothes in           which to appear with decency on the occasion of taking his baptismal vows, and received two dollars,--sixteen- fold more than Col. Suttle ever gave him at any one time, before or after.             At the proper time he was baptized and received into the Baptist church at Falmouth. The church consisted of white freemen and black slaves. All assembled within the same walls for worship on the Sabbath, but a partition of boards separated the bond from the free. When the Holy Supper was administered, the cup was first carefully served to all of the privileged class, and afterward to their sable brethren. Those distinctions were not maintained in anticipation of heaven, but in deference to the prejudices of Virginia society. In the social religious meetings there was a somewhat nearer approach to the New Testament model, and the prayers and exhortations of the slaves were graciously suffered to intermingle with those proceeding from the master's lips.             Among the Christian slaves at the south there is a class of persons that bear the character of quasi-pastors or preachers. Without being formally set apart to the sacred office by any rite of ordination, they yet receive a sort of recognition from the church with which they may happen to be connected. Piety, a gift at exhortation, and a desire for the work of a preacher, are the requisite qualifications. All these were found in Anthony when, at the end of two years from the period of his baptism, he applied to his brethren for their recognition      
   brick of clay, and to the dust of clay it returns again, the same way God made us, unto dust we return again. Aaron's views of poor feeble hollow hearted dying men.           A great many people tell me about this awful bad amalgamation business, and they think when friendly people took me in and set me down to the table to eat with them, and when their acquaintances come in to see them, and see Aaron sitting up to the table eating with them it draws a dead damp on them, it is like Adne and Anthony. Aaron thinks if they would only look in the South where I come from, it will be a complete ballot box for them, they would put their hand right on their mouth and never utter another word about amalgamation, or any thing else. In the South white man wont suffer black man to look at white woman, but they will go and force black woman, and there  aint  eh or Anthony said about it. The very old devil has got his own foot right on the slave holders own neck, and Aaron thinks the poor slave holder cannot see sin and folly until he is shut up among the damned in hell forever.           When Aaron falls in with sincere christian people, they treat me like a brother, but not as a slave, and they let the way-faring Aaron eat when they eat, and don't keep me waiting till they are done eating, and then give me a crust of bread and a piece of old stale meat in the kitchen, the way a great many ministers do in my travels. Aaron says he should as live go to hear the devil preach as to hear some ministers, because they preach one thing and practice another, and don't begin to live up to their doctrine. We should always practice what we preach to others, for a man of words and not of deeds, is like a garden full of weeds. So Aaron says.                  PAUL TO THE GALATIANS.--5 chap. 19. Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these:--Adultery, fornication, uncleanliness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresy,  c.,  c. But the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, faith, meekness        temperance, against such there is no law. Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.           REV. i. 12--15. And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks; and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of Man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle. His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire.           REV. 1: 15. I beheld till thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garments was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool. DAN. 7--9.           Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant that is escaped from his master unto thee. He shall dwell with thee, even among you in that place which he shall choose in one of thy gates. Where it liketh him best; thou shalt not oppress him. DEUT. 23: 15--16.           He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressing, that shaketh his hand from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ear from hearing of blood and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil; he shall dwell on high; his place of defence shall be the munition of rocks, bread shall be given him his waters shall be sure. ISA. 33: 15, 16.           Aaron's views on God's holy word, strictly forbids us holding our brethren in bonds, and here is several chapters against it.           Is it such a Fast that I have chosen? A day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? Wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the Lord?           Is not this the fast that I have chosen? To loose the bands of wickedness, to undo   the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?           Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out of thy house? When thou seest the naked that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?           Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily; and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the Lord shall be their reward. Isa. 58: 5--8.           Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so to them; for this is the law and the prophets. Matt. 7: 12.           Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; that useth his neighbor's service without wages, and giveth him not for his work; that saith, I will build me a wide house, and large chambers, and cutteth him out windows and it is ceiled with cedar and painted with vermilion. Shalt thou reign because thou closest thyself in cedar? Did not thy father eat        and drink, and do judgment and justice, and then was it well with him? He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well with him: was not this to know me? saith the Lord. But thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy covetousness, and for to shed innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it.           Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah. They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah lord! or Ah his glory! Jeremiah 22d chap. 13 to 15.           Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you. Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver is cankered, and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire,--ye have heaped treasures together for the last days. Behold, the hire of the laborers who have reapt down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth. And the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of  Sabaoth.  Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton, ye have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter. Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you. Be patient, therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. James 5th chap. 1st to 7th verses.               That's the way it is with the Christian, when his warfare is ended here below. Here is a short sentence of the wayfaring Aaron.            When Aaron was in Hallowell in the State of Maine, a gentleman told him there were 52 strong anti-slavery families lived in H., but he could not get a soul good enough to take him in. He thinks if it had been winter he should have frozen to death, but providentially it was warm weather. He laid himself down upon a harrow, but the little red and black ants troubled him so he was obliged to seek shelter some where else. He tarried the rest of the night in a privy. When he arose he found a beautiful morning: he walked four miles, then asked a gentleman if he would give him some breakfast; he told him he was drunk and foolish, and ought to go to the Asylum. He proceeded to two houses farther and there the Lord opened their hearts. They provided him with a good breakfast, which refreshed him much, and they gave him food     
                It was nearly rolling season when Aunt Jane first came to Louisiana, and we all was so busy working night and day I did not have a chance to see her in a long time after I left her that Sunday evening. But two or three months after that I got a chance to go to see her again. Old marster let me go and stay all day that Sunday. He said we all had made such a good year's work, and he was mighty well pleased with us. But he was not always glad and pleased with us. Sometimes he would get mad about something going wrong on the place, and he would beat every one of us and lock us up in the jail he made for us.               What! Did he put you in jail on Sunday?               Yes; 'most every Sunday morning when we did not have any work to do. The next time I went to see Aunt Jane we had another happy time. She could read right good in the Bible and hymn-book, and she would read to me one or two hymns at a time. I remember she read to me about Daniel in the lions' den, and about the king having the three Hebrew children cast in the fiery furnace, and when he looked in the flames of fire he saw four men,          and one looked like the Son of God. O, how Aunt Jane used to love to read about the Hebrew children!              I finally got religion, and it was Aunt Jane's praying and singing them old Virginia hymns that helped me so much. Aunt Jane's marster would let her come to see me sometimes, but not often. Sometimes she would slip away from her place at night and come to see me anyhow. She would hold prayer-meeting in my house whenever she would come to see me.               Would your marster allow you to hold prayer-meeting on his place?               No, my child; if old marster heard us singing and praying he would come out and make us stop. One time, I remember, we all were having a prayer-meeting in my cabin, and marster came up to the door and hollered out,  'You, Charlotte,  what's all that fuss in there?' We all had to hush up for that night. I was so afraid old marster would see Aunt Jane. I knew Aunt Jane would have to suffer if her white people knew she was off at night. Marster used to say God was tired of us all hollering to him at night.       
       Thy work now begins in my vineyard; go out upon the highways and cry aloud.  But I excuse myself,  saying:  I don't know what to cry.  And the Lord  say:  I put in thy heart and in thy mouth what to  say. Fear not, for I will be with thee, and bring thee  off conqueror and more than conqueror.  And about this time, when in my bed, I was often attended with visions, with views of congregations sitting to hear the Word.            For a long time I cry, unworthy to undertake the task; but God at length prepare, and I promised to do the best I could. And  God prepare me to this day.  And when it come, I do the best I can.            I was twenty-three years old when I did not know a letter; after that I managed, for two months, to go two nights in a week to see a black maid who  could  spell a little, and she instructed me to spell in three syllables; and that was  all the learning I got from human. After that my Heavenly Master took me in hand and nursed me, and learned me to read the Bible to good understanding. He first give me faith, then  He revealed to me.  But most other books I have tried to read is a mystery to me. From the time of my conversion to this moment, I have never doubted the grace of God; for I have found all doubting comes from a wicked heart. I do feel, while I am relating this to you, that I have great cause to bless the Lord, for he has nursed me through all the journey of my life, and has been my comforter in distress, when trouble, like a gloomy cloud, has overshadowed me  by the loss of three of my children--being taken from  my bosom, sold and taken South. But here I got some consolation, reflecting upon  Joseph being sold into Egypt.  Like Jacob,     
       CHAPTER IX.             IT is impossible to reconcile the mind of the native  slave to the idea of living in a state of perfect equality,  end boundless affection, with the white people. Heaven  will be no heaven to him, if he is not to be avenged of  his enemies. I know, from experience, that these are  the fundamental rules of his religious creed; because  I learned them in the religious meetings of the slaves  themselves. A favorite and kind master or mistress,  may now and then be admitted into heaven, but this  rather as a matter of favor, to the intercession of some  slave, than as matter of strict justice to the whites,  who will, by no means, be of an equal rank with those  who shall be raised from the depths of misery, in this  world.            The idea of a revolution in the conditions of the  whites and the blacks, is the corner-stone of the religion  of the latter; and indeed, it seems to me, at  least, to be quite natural, if not in strict accordance  with the precepts of the Bible; for in that book I find           it every where laid down, that those who have possessed  an inordinate portion of the good things of this  world, and have lived in ease and luxury, at the expense of their fellow men will surely have to render an  account of their stewardship, and be punished, for  having withheld from others the participation of those  blessings, which they themselves enjoyed.            There is no subject which presents to the mind of  the male slave a greater contrast between his own condition  and that of his master, than the relative station  and appearance of his wife and his mistress. The one,  poorly clad, poorly fed, and exposed to all the hardships  of the cotton field; the other dressed in clothes  of gay and various colors, ornamented with jewelry,  and carefully protected from the rays of the sun, and  the blasts of the wind.            As I have before observed, the Africans have feelings  peculiar to themselves; but with an American slave,  the possession of the spacious house, splendid furniture,  and fine horses of his master, are but the secondary  objects of his desires. To fill the measure of his happiness,  and crown his highest ambition, his young and  beautiful mistress must adorn his triumph, and enliven  his hopes.            I have been drawn into the above reflections, by the  recollection of an event of a most melancholy character,  which took place when I had been on this plantation      
      CHAPTER II.              A fruitless effort for education.--The Sabbath among Slaves.-- Degrading amusements.--Why religion is rejected.--Condition of poor white people.--Superstition among slaves.--Education forbidden.              IN 1833, I had some very serious religious impressions, and there was quite a number of slaves in that neighborhood, who felt very desirous to be taught to read the Bible. There was a Miss Davis, a poor white girl, who offered to teach a Sabbath School for the slaves, notwithstanding public opinion and the law was opposed to it. Books were furnished and she commenced the school; but the news soon got to our owners that she was teaching us to read. This caused quite an excitement in the neighborhood. Patrols  *               *Police peculiar to the South.    were appointed to go and break it up the next Sabbath. They were determined that we should not have a Sabbath School in operation. For slaves this was called an incendiary Movement.             The Sabbath is not regarded by a large number of the slaves as a day of rest. They have no schools to go to; no moral nor religious instruction at all in many localities where there are hundreds of    
     had reached my twelfth year, that if I was spared to become a man, I would try to be as good as my parents. My father could read a little, and make figures, but could scarcely write at all. His custom, on those Sabbaths when we remained at home, was to spend his time in instructing his children, or the neighboring servants, out of a New Testament, sent him from Fredericksburg by one of his older sons. I fancy I can see him now, sitting under his bush arbor, reading that precious book to many attentive hearers around him.             Such was the esteem I had for my pious father, that I have kept that blessed book ever since his death, for his sake; and it was the first New Testament I read, after I felt the pardoning love of God in my soul.             My father died, August 20, 1826, aged 60 years. My mother, Jane Davis, at the death of my father, removed from the farm, where my father died, and spent the remainder of her days in Fredericksburg, with her children. She lived to good old age, and fell asleep in Jesus, Dec. 24, 1831.             My father had been allowed to keep a cow and horse, for his own use; and to raise and feed his hogs and poultry from the mill.--     
    revealed himself to these poor souls, for they were  very ignorant  -  they did not know a letter of the Bible.  But when they opened their mouths they were filled,  and the plan of Salvation was explained in a way  that all could receive it. It was always a mystery to  the white brethren how the slaves could line out  hymns, preach Christ and redemption, yet have no  knowledge even of how the name of Christ was  spelled. They were illiterate to the last degree, so  there is but one theory, they were inspired. God  revealed unto them just what they should teach their  flock, the same as he did to Moses. I remember very  well that there was always a solemnity about the  services  -  a certain harmony, which had a peculiar  effect  -  a certain pathetic tone which quickened the  emotions as they sang those old plantation hymns.  It mattered not what their troubles had been during  the week  -  how much they had been lashed, the  prayer-meeting on Saturday evening never failed to be held. Their faith was tried and true. On Sunday  afternoons, they would all congregate again to praise  God, and the congregation was enthusiastic. It was  pathetic to hear them pray, from the depths of their  hearts, for them who  despitefully used them and     
     in some degree. But he resolved to remove the obstacle in the way of his scheme; and he thought he had planned it so that he should evade suspicion. He was well aware how much I prized my refuge by the side of my old aunt, and he determined to dispossess me of it. The first night the doctor had the little child in his room alone. The next morning, I was ordered to take my station as nurse the following night. A kind Providence interposed in my favor. During the day Mrs. Flint heard of this new arrangement, and a storm followed. I rejoiced to hear it rage.           After a while my mistress sent for me to come to her room. Her first question was,  Did you know you were to sleep in the doctor's room?             Yes, ma'am.             Who told you?             My master.             Will you answer truly all the questions I ask?             Yes, ma'am.             Tell me, then, as you hope to be forgiven, are you innocent of what I have accused you?             I am.            She handed me a Bible, and said,  Lay your hand on your heart, kiss this holy book, and swear before God that you tell me the truth.            I took the oath she required, and I did it with a clear conscience.            You have taken God's holy word to testify your innocence,  said she.  If you have deceived me, beware! Now take this stool, sit down, look me directly in the face, and tell me all that has passed between your master and you.        
     But now I thought that if my master would only come to Jesus he could be saved. I began to pray for the white people, and to tell all around what a dear Salvation I had found.      SPIRITUAL FREEDOM.              Free indeed,  John viii., 36. I had now a free soul. But my poor mother, who had taught me the Lord's Prayer and for years been so anxious that I should  seek religion,  had never herself understood the finished work of Christ. She now, however, accepted Him as her own Saviour, and gave herself to the Lord in glad and full surrender. I was anxious, after my conversion, to unite with the Baptist Church. In Richmond there were Churches of coloured people, but they had white Pastors, who never failed to keep us informed about Abraham's servants, and as to the injunction to Hagar. I could not join any Church unless I had a  pass  from my master. I went to him and asked permission to be baptised. He at once said:  No, you shall not unite with the Baptist Church.  Mr. Brown, my spiritual adviser, told me to go to the Lord, and say,  Lord, if Thou hast ever done anything for my never-dying soul, please manifest Thyself to me in moving the master to give me a pass to be baptised.  I think it was nearly three months before I again ventured to ask him. But when I summoned up enough courage to ask him the second time, he at once gave permission. This was a manifest answer to prayer. When the appointed Sabbath for baptism arrived, my mother and I  went down into the water  hand-in-hand, and were baptised, rejoicing in the privilege of following our Divine Master, and when we  came up out of the water  we  went on our way rejoicing.              Soon after my conversion I felt a deep desire to preach the Gospel. But two difficulties presented themselves: first, I was a slave, for though I had a free soul, yet my body was in slavery; then, second, I could not read the          Bible with much understanding, and there was no way for me to succeed but the old way, that, was, by  taking advantage of every opportunity to learn all I could.  Just about this time a young student (white) came from College on the Sabbaths to preach to the coloured people. He read the fifth chapter of Matthew. I was much struck with his explanation, and I became anxious to know how to read this chapter. Now there was a box of old books stored away in a lumber room, and amongst these books was a large old Bible. I took this Bible to my room, and day after day, when I had finished my work in the house, and had a little time to spare, I would go to my room, lock myself in, and try to read the Bible, commencing at Genesis and calling over the letters of each word I could not understand as follows:-- In the b-e-g-i-n-n-i-n-g God c-r-e-a-t-e-d the heaven and the earth ; and thus I struggled on from day to day. The young master had been requested by his mother to read a chapter in the New Testament every night. Often when with him in his own room at night I would get him to read the fifth chapter of Matthew for me. To the reading of this I would listen attentively. Thus I got to know the words  multitudes,   mountain,   disciples,   blessed,  and in time I had learned to repeat many verses of the chapter from memory. I then began to look about in the Bible, and found in many places the same words in the first and second syllables that I knew. In this way I got to understand a little about the Bible, and at the same time I was learning to spell. After my conversion I would often  Steal away to Jesus  with other slaves, to some quiet place for prayer, over the stable, or in the kitchen when the master and mistress were away, though we knew that if we were discovered we should be locked up for the night, and that the next morning we should receive from five to nine or even thirty lashes for unlawfully assembling together. Over five slaves in such a gathering, though they had passes,     
      pair shoes, one pair stockings, one pair woolen pants, one coat, two pairs coarse tow linen pants, two shirts, and board, is the law of the State of Maryland allows a man, free or slave, black or white, who hires for one year.             My friends who may read this little work, will make due allowance when they see that I never possessed the advantage of one day's schooling in my life, and only commenced to learn my letters when nineteen years and eight months old.             At one time, when going to my work, I found a piece of a chapter of an old Bible, Genesis 25, concerning Isaac, Jacob, and Esau. At this time there was an old colored man working for my father. He, taking the piece of Bible, and read it to me; I do not remember ever hearing that much of the Bible read before. I told him I would like to learn to read; he told me to get a book and he would learn me, while he stayed with us. I bought a little     
    that if God would have mercy on me, I should never sin again. When I had come to this, I felt my guilt give way, and thought that I was a new being. Now, instead of looking with my real eyes to see my Savior, I felt him in me, and I was happy. The eyes of my mind were open, and I saw things as I never did before. With my mind's eye, I could see my Redeemer hanging upon the cross for me.             I wanted all the other slaves to see him thus, and feel as happy as I did. I used to talk to others, and tell them of the friend they would have in Jesus, and show them by my experience how I was brought to Christ, and felt his love within my heart,--and love it was, in God's adapting himself to my capacity.             After receiving this revelation from the Lord, I became impressed that I was called of God to preach to the other slaves. I labored under this impression for seven years, but then I could not read the Bible, and I thought I could never preach unless I learned to read the Bible, but I had no one to teach me how to read. A friend showed me the letters, and how to spell words of three letters. Then I continued, until I got so as to read the Bible,--the great book of God,--the source of all knowledge. It was my great desire to read easily this book. I thought it was written by the Almighty himself. I loved this book, and prayed over it and labored until I could read it. I used to go to the church to hear the white preacher. When I heard him read his text, I would read mine when I got borne. This is the way, my readers, I learned to read the Word of God when I was a slave. Thus did I labor eleven years under the impression that I was called to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ, the ever-blessed God.             Then I learned to write. Here I had no teaching; but I obtained a book with the writing alphabet in it. I copied the letters until I could write. I had no slate, so I used to     
       knees before God prayed for this individual. The next morning the person came and asked her pardon. How beautifully  does this illustrate the passage,  Dearly beloved, avenge not  yourselves.  Again, returning home from meeting, one dark evening, with her head bowed down as usual, she was  accosted,  Where are  you  bound, old woman?   To  Canaan's happy land,   she answered.             Phebe  loved the Scriptures.  Near by her, and always on her mind and heart, was her   precious Holy Bible,  and her large-print Testament. Phebe had the same Bible that others  have, but she found in it a great deal more than is commonly found, as all may observe who have seen her Bible. There  the promises, and the threatenings and warnings too, are  marked or underscored by her pen or pencil. Phebe's marks beneath or beside a passage, made often with a heavy stroke  of her pencil, come to our minds with the force of a  commentary, for she was herself a  living epistle,   known and read  by us all. Said her  pastor,  *    If a thousand devoted Christians were requested  to mark their favourite texts and  expressions, it is believed they would hardly mark one not understood by Phebe.                  * Phebe was a Member of the Congregational Church of  America, corresponding to the  Independents in England.               Phebe  loved the house of God.  She took great delight in the services of the sanctuary: hence  she was never absent except from sickness or urgent necessity. She was indeed a pillar of the church; one in whom the  minister found support by her constant attendance and  prayers, by her cordial reception and love of the truth. She was the first to be seated in her place at church. For many years, in our former house of worship, she was seen sitting in  one corner of the gallery, on the furthest row of seats, with her head bowed in secret prayer. To look up to her as we entered the house of God was, to some of us at least, a prayer, a  sermon, a hymn of praise. The last winter, her health failing, she was unable to walk to church as formerly, and remained during the intermission--a season highly           prized by some of her Christian friends, who would hasten back to meet her. That glowing look of hers, that close pressure of the hand, that Sabbath-day greeting, will never be  forgotten. The best, the most experienced Christians loved to be with Phebe, because she was a happy, Bible Christian, a witness to the truth of God.             Phebe  loved to pray . Many times a day would she go to her bedroom, carpeted as for a little sanctuary, and kneel and pray. So much was her soul awake to the interests of Zion, it was  no uncommon occurrence for her to arise at  midnight  and pray.  At midnight I will arise, and give thanks unto Thee.  This is a marked passage in her Bible. About four years since,  her pastor was strengthened more than usual in his labors; his soul was richly fed with heavenly manna; and of this bread many of his flock partook with him. Not long after this  season of refreshing, it was ascertained that Phebe had arisen  every night, month after month, at midnight,  to pray for her pastor.             Many were the  individuals  for whom she prayed. During the past winter a friend called to see her.  What is the good word?  said Phebe.  Anna--is serious, and inquiring the way  of life.  She arose at once from her seat, lifted her hands, and with tears of joy praised God aloud, and said,  For  her  I have been praying; God is a bearer of prayer.              Phebe's  faith and confidence in God were practical,  and availed her in time of need. When her mistress, Mrs. Allen, died, whom she loved more than any being on earth, and whose  death was very sudden, in the dead of night, causing great distress in the family, Phebe calmly said,  Don't we pray, 'Thy will be done?' and now it is done.              Phebe  gave of her substance.  She made a monthly contribution of fifty cents to missions, and bequeathed her little all, remaining after her decease, to the cause of Christ.             Phebe  prayed for the college.  The officers and students she bore on her heart to God. She  always manifested a deep interest in the annual concert of      
    and advise them to fix their minds upon the Savior, as their only helper. Some I have heard curse and swear in answer, and others would say that they could not keep their minds upon God and the devil (meaning Huckstep) at the same time: that it was of no use to try to be religious  -   they had no time  -  that the overseer wouldn't let them meet to pray  -  and that even uncle Solomon, when he prayed, had to keep one eye open all the time, to see if Huckstep was coming. Uncle Solomon could both read and write, and had brought out with him from Virginia a Bible, a hymn-book, and some other religious books, which he carefully concealed from the overseer.  Huckstep was himself an open infidel as well as blasphemer. He used to tell the hands that there was no hell hereafter for white people, but that they had their punishment on earth in being obliged to take care of the negroes. As for the blacks, he was sure there was a hell for them. He used frequently to sit with his bottle by his side, and his Bible in his hand, and read passages and comment on them, and pronounce them lies. Any thing like religious feeling among the slaves irritated him. He said that so much praying and singing         prevented the people from doing their tasks, as it kept them up nights, when they should be asleep. He used to mock, and in every possible way interrupt the poor slaves, who, after the toil of the day, knelt in their lowly cabins to offer their prayers and supplications to Him whose ear is open to the sorrowful sighing of the prisoner, and who hath promised in his own time to come down and deliver. In his drunken seasons he would make excursions at night through the slave-quarters, enter the cabins, and frighten the inmates, especially if engaged in prayer or psalm-singing. On one of these occasions he came back rubbing his hands and laughing. He said he had found uncle Solomon in his garden, down on his knees, praying like an old owl, and had tipped him over and frightened him half out of his wits. At another time he found uncle David sitting on his stool with his face thrust up the chimney, in order that his voice might not be heard by his brutal persecutor. He was praying, giving utterance to these words, probably in reference to his bondage:   -    How long, oh Lord, how long?    As long as my whip!  cried the overseer, who had stolen         behind him, giving him a blow. It was the sport of a demon.            Not long after my master had left us, the overseer ascertained for the first time that some of the hands could read, and that they had brought books with them from Virginia. He compelled them to give up the keys of their chests, and on searching found several Bibles and hymn-books. Uncle Solomon's chest contained quite a library, which he could read at night by the light of knots of the pitch-pine. These books he collected together, and in the evening called uncle Solomon into the house. After jeering him for some tinge, he gave him one of the Bibles and told him to name his text and preach him a sermon. The old man was silent. He then made him get upon the table, and ordered him to pray. Uncle Solomon meekly replied that  forced prayer was not good for soul or body.  The overseer then knelt down himself, and in a blasphemous manner prayed that the Lord would send his spirit into uncle Solomon, or else let the old man fall from the table and break his neck, and so have an end of  nigger  preaching. On getting up from his knees he went to the cupboard, poured out a glass         of brandy for himself, and brought another to the table.  James,  said he, addressing me,  uncle Solomon stands there, for all the world, like a Hickory Quaker. His spirit don't move; I'll see if another spirit won't move it.  He compelled the old preacher to swallow the brandy, and then told him to preach and exhort, for the spirit was in him. He set one of the Bibles on fire, and after it was consumed mixed up the ashes of it in a glass of water, and compelled the old man to drink it, telling him that as the spirit and the word were now both in him, there was no longer any excuse for not preaching. After tormenting the wearied old man in this way until nearly midnight, he permitted him to go to his quarters.            The next day I saw uncle Solomon, and talked with him about his treatment. He said it would not always be so  -  that slavery was to come to an end, for the Bible said so  -  that there would then be no more whippings and fightings, but the lion and the lamb would lie down together, and all would be love. He said he prayed for Huckstep   -  that it was not he, but the devil in him, who behaved so. At his request, I found means to get him a Bible and a hymn-book from the overseers     
    mean, Jim, by insulting me in that manner? Asking the Lord to convert me over again. And praying that I might be shaken over hell. I have a great mind to tie you up, and give you a good correcting. If you ever make another such a prayer, I'll whip you well, that I will.             Dr. Gaines felt so intensely the duty of masters to their slaves that he, with some of his neighbors, inaugurated a religious movement, whereby the blacks at the Corners could have preaching once a fortnight, and that, too, by an educated white man. Rev. John Mason, the man selected for this work, was a heavy-set, fleshy, lazy man who, when entering a house, sought the nearest chair, taking possession, of it, and holding it to the last.            He had been employed many years as a colporteur or missionary, sometimes preaching to the poor whites, and, at other times, to the slaves, for which service he was compensated either by planters, or by the dominant religious denomination in the section where he labored. Mr. Mason had carefully studied the character of the people, to whom he was called to preach, and took every opportunity to shirk his duties, and to throw them upon some of the slaves, a large number of whom were always ready and willing to exhort when called upon.            We shall never forget his first sermon, and the profound sensation that it created both amongst masters and slaves, and especially the latter. After taking for his text,  He that knoweth his master's         will, and doeth it not, shall be beaten with many stripes,  he spoke substantially as follows:--              Now when  correction  is given you, you either deserve it, or you do not deserve it. But whether you really deserve it or not, it is your duty, and Almighty God requires that you bear it patiently. You may, perhaps, think that this is hard doctrine, but if you consider it right you must needs think otherwise of it. Suppose then, that you deserve correction, you cannot but say that it is just and right you should meet with it. Suppose you do not, or at least you do not deserve so much, or so severe a correction for the fault you have committed, you, perhaps, have escaped a great many more, and are at last paid for all. Or suppose you are quite innocent of what is laid to your charge, and suffer wrongfully in that particular thing, is it not possible you may have done some other bad thing which was never discovered, and that Almighty God, who saw you doing it, would not let you escape without punishment one time or another? And ought you not, in such a case, to give glory to Him, and be thankful that he would rather punish you in this life for your wickedness, than destroy your souls for it in the next life? But suppose that even this was not the case (a case hardly to be imagined), and that you have by no means, known or unknown, deserved the correction you suffered, there is this great comfort in it, that if you bear it patiently, and leave your cause in the hands of God, he will reward you for it in heaven, and the punishment you suffer         unjustly here, shall turn to your exceeding great glory, hereafter.             At this point, the preacher hesitated a moment, and then continued,  I am now going to give you a description of hell, that awful place, that you will surely go to, if you don't be good and faithful servants.             Hell is a great pit, more than two hundred feet deep, and is walled up with stone, having a strong, iron grating at the top. The fire is built of pitch pine knots, tar barrels, lard kegs, and butter firkins. One of the devil's imps appears twice a day, and throws about half a bushel of brimstone on the fire, which is never allowed to cease burning. As sinners die they are pitched headlong into the pit, and are at once taken up upon the pitchforks by the devil's imps, who stand, with glaring eyes and smiling countenances, ready to do their master's work.             Here the speaker was disturbed by the  Amens,   Bless God, I'll keep out of hell,   Dat's my sentiments,  which plainly told him that he had struck the right key.             Now,  continued the preacher,  I will tell you where heaven is, and how you are to obtain a place there. Heaven is above the skies; its streets are paved with gold; seraphs and angels will furnish you with music which never ceases. You will all be permitted to join in the singing and you will be fed on manna and honey, and you will drink from fountains, and will ride in golden chariots.              I am bound for hebben,  ejaculated one.                     Yes, blessed God, hebben will be my happy home,  said another.            These outbursts of feeling were followed, while the man of God stood with folded arms, enjoying the sensation that his eloquence had created.            After pausing a moment or two, the reverend man continued,  Are there any of you here who would rather burn in hell than rest in heaven? Remember that once in hell you can never get out. If you attempt to escape little devils are stationed at the top of the pit, who will, with their pitchforks, toss you back into the pit,  curchunk,  where you must remain forever. But once in heaven, you will be free the balance of your days.  Here the wildest enthusiasm showed itself, amidst which the preacher took his seat.            A rather humorous incident now occurred which created no little merriment amongst the blacks, and to the somewhat discomfiture of Dr. Gaines,--who occupied a seat with the whites who were present.            Looking about the room, being unacquainted with the negroes, and presuming that all or nearly so were experimentally interested in religion, Mr. Mason called on Ike to close with prayer. The very announcement of Ike's name in such a connection called forth a broad grin from the larger portion of the audience.            Now, it so happened that Ike not only made no profession of religion, but was in reality the farthest off from the church of any of the servants at  Poplar Farm ; yet Ike was equal to the occasion, and at         once responded, to the great amazement of his fellow slaves.            Ike had been, from early boyhood, an attendant upon whites, and he had learned to speak correctly for an uneducated person. He was pretty well versed in Scripture and had learned the principal prayer that his master was accustomed to make, and would often get his follow-servants together at the barn on a rainy day and give them the prayer, with such additions and improvements as the occasion might suggest. Therefore, when called upon by Mr. Mason, Ike at once said,  Let us pray.             After floundering about for a while, as if feeling his way, the new beginner struck out on the well-committed prayer, and soon elicited a loud  amen,  and  bless God for that,  from Mr. Mason, and to the great amusement of the blacks. In his eagerness, however, to make a grand impression, Ike attempted to weave into his prayer some poetry on  Cock Robin,  which he had learned, and which nearly spoiled his maiden prayer.            After the close of the meeting, the Doctor invited the preacher to remain over night, and accepting the invitation, we in the great house had an opportunity of learning more of the reverend man's religious views.            When comfortably seated in the parlor, the Doctor said,  I was well pleased with your discourse, I think the tendency will be good upon the servants.              Yes,  responded the minister,  The negro is eminently a religious being, more so, I think, than          the white race. He is emotional, loves music, is wonderfully gifted with gab; the organ of alimentativeness largely developed, and is fond of approbation. I therefore try always to satisfy their vanity; call upon them to speak, sing, and pray, and sometimes to preach. That suits for this world. Then I give them a heaven with music in it, and with something to eat. Heaven without singing and food would be no place for the negro. In the cities, where many of them are free, and have control of their own time, they are always late to church meetings, lectures, or almost anything else. But let there be a festival or supper announced and they are all there on time.              But did you know,  said Dr. Gaines,  that the prayer that Ike made to-day he learned from me?              Indeed?  responded the minister.             Yes, that boy has the imitative power of his race in a larger degree than most negroes that I have seen. He remembers nearly everything that he hears, is full of wit, and has most excellent judgment. However, his dovetailing the Cock Robin poetry into my prayer was too much, and I had to laugh at his adroitness.             The Doctor was much pleased with the minister, but Mrs. Gaines was not. She had great contempt for professional men who sprung from the lower class, and she regarded Mr. Mason as one to be endured but not encouraged. The Rev. Henry Pinchen was her highest idea of a clergyman. This gentleman was then expected in the neighborhood,     
     died, but my mother said, she died gently and happily, as if her last hours were a foretaste of what was in store for her.             A badge of aristocracy among slaveholders is the number of slaves they hold, and white people of equal fortune are not generally allowed to visit slaveholders, who look down upon them with a species of contempt. One remarkable fact which I wish to impress upon my readers is this, that the white men born in those districts in America where slaves are held, are just as capable of bearing the heat as the black men. And the proof is this, that in the harvest-time, when the two are working together in the fields, the white men can actually beat the negroes at the work, and very often the black man has to give up, and is laughed at by the white labourer. They say,  Only give us sufficient wages, and we will work by the side of any nigger alive.  It is quite shocking to hear slaveholders distorting even the Bible itself to prove that a negro alone was made for hard work.       Cunning of Slaves.              I remember a slave, who was not treated very well with respect to food and other things, when he had done his work being lectured by his mistress on the duties of a slave, she telling him that in proportion to his obedience and servility as a slave he would be loved by God. One day, on receiving     
     members of families by sale--but not of mine. With me and my house, the tenderer tendrils of the heart still clung to where the vine had entwined; pleasant was its shade and delicious our fruits to our taste, though we knew, and what is more, we  felt  that we were slaves. But all around I could see where the vine had been torn down, and its bleeding branches told of vanished joys, and of new wrought sorrows, such as, slave though I was, had never entered into my practical experience.            I had never been permitted to learn to read; but I used to attend church, and there I received instruction which I trust was of some benefit to me.  I trusted, too, that I had experienced the renewing influences of the gospel; and after obtaining from my mistress a written  permit  (a thing  always  required in such a case,) I had been baptised and received into fellowship with the Baptist denomination.  So that in religious matters, I had been indulged in the exercise of my own conscience--a favor not always granted to slaves.  Indeed I, with others, was often told by the minister how good God was in bringing us over to this country from dark and benighted Africa, and permitting us to listen to the sound of the gospel. To me, God also granted temporal freedom, which man without God's consent, had stolen away.            I often heard select portions of the scriptures          read.  And on the Sabbath there was one sermon preached expressly for the colored people which it was generally my privilege to hear.  I became quite familiar with the texts,  Servants be obedient to your masters. -- Not with eye service as men pleasers. -- He that knoweth his master's will and doeth it not, shall be beaten with many stripes,  and others of this class: for they formed the basis of most of these public instructions to us.  The first commandment impressed upon our minds was to obey our masters, and the second was like unto it, namely, to do as much work when they or the overseers were not watching us as when they were.  But connected with these instructions there was more or less that was truly excellent; though mixed up with much that would sound strangely in the ears of freedom.  There was one very kind hearted Episcopal minister whom I often used to hear; he was very popular with the colored people.  But after he had preached a sermon to us in which he argued from the Bible that it was the will of heaven from all eternity we should be slaves, and our masters be our owners, most of us left him; for like some of the faint hearted disciples in early times we said,-- This is a hard saying, who can bear it?             My manumission, as I shall call it; that is, the bill of sale conveying me to Mr. Smith, was dated Sept. 9th, 1835. I continued     
    rendered me somewhat notorious. More than once I heard it said that Platt Ford, now Platt Tibeats a slave's name changes with his change of master was  a devil of a nigger.  But I was destined to make a still further noise, as will presently be seen, throughout the little world of Bayou Boeuf.  	        Peter Tanner endeavored to impress upon me the idea that he was quite severe, though I could perceive there was a vein of good humor in the old fellow, after all.  	         You're the nigger,  he said to me on my arrival   You're the nigger that flogged your master, eh? You're the nigger that kicks, and holds carpenter Tibeats by the leg, and wallops him, are ye? I'd like to see you hold me by the leg I should. You're a 'portant character you're a great nigger very remarkable nigger, ain't ye?  I'd  lash you  I'd  take the tantrums out of ye. Jest take hold of my leg, if you please. None of your pranks here, my boy, remember  that . Now go to work, you  kickin ' rascal,  concluded Peter Tanner, unable to suppress a half-comical grin at his own wit and sarcasm.  	        After listening to this salutation, I was taken charge of by Myers and labored under his direction for a month, to his and my own satisfaction.  	        Like William Ford, his brother-in-law, Tanner was in the habit of reading the Bible to his slaves on the Sabbath, but in a somewhat different spirit. He was an impressive commentator on the New Testament. The first Sunday after my coming to the plantation,         he called them together, and began to read the twelfth chapter of Luke. When he came to the 47th verse, he looked deliberately around him, and continued   And that servant which knew his lord's will,  here he paused, looking around more deliberately than before, and again proceeded  which knew his lord's  will , and  prepared  not himself  here was another pause   prepared  not himself, neither did  according  to his will, shall be beaten with many  stripes .   	         D'ye hear that?  demanded Peter, emphatically.   Stripes ,  he repeated, slowly and distinctly, taking off his spectacles, preparatory to making a few remarks.  	         That nigger that don't take care that don't obey his lord that's his master d'ye see? that ' ere  nigger shall be beaten with many stripes. Now, 'many' signifies a  great  many forty, a hundred, a hundred and fifty lashes.  That's  Scripter!  and so Peter continued to elucidate the subject for a great length of time, much to the edification of his sable audience.  	        At the conclusion of the exercises, calling up three of his slaves, Warner, Will and Major or, he cried out to me   	         Here, Platt, you held Tibeats by the legs; now I'll see if you can hold these rascals in the same way, till I get back from meetin'.   	        Thereupon he ordered them to the stocks a common thing on plantations in the Red River country. The stocks are formed of two planks, the lower one         made fast at the ends to two short posts, driven firmly into the ground. At regular distances half circles are cut in the upper edge. The other plank is fastened to one of the posts by a hinge, so that it can be opened or shut down, in the same manner as the blade of a pocket-knife is shut or opened. In the lower edge of the upper plank corresponding half circles are also cut, so that when they close, a row of holes is formed large enough to admit a negro's leg above the ankle, but not large enough to enable him to draw out his foot. The other end of the upper plank, opposite the hinge, is fastened to its post by lock and key. The slave is made to sit upon the ground, when the uppermost prank is elevated, his legs, just above the ankles, placed in the sub-half circles, and shutting it down again, and locking it, he is held secure and fast. Very often the neck instead of the ankle is enclosed. In this manner they are held during the operation of whipping.  	        Warner, Will and Major, according to Tanner's account of them, were melon-stealing, Sabbath breaking niggers, and not approving of such wickedness, he felt it his duty to put them in the stocks. Handing me the key, himself, Myers, Mistress Tanner and the children entered the carriage and drove away to church at Cheneyville. When they were gone, the boys begged me to let them out. I felt sorry to see them sitting on the hot ground, and remembered my own sufferings in the sun. Upon their promise to return to the stocks at any moment they were required         to do so, I consented to release them. Grateful for the lenity shown them, and in order in some measure to repay it, they could do no less, of course, than pilot me to the melon-patch. Shortly before Tanner's return, they were in the stocks again. Finally he drove up, and looking at the boys, said, with a chuckle,   	         Aha! ye havn't been strolling about much to-day, any way.  I'll  teach you what's what.  I'll  tire ye of eating water-melons on the Lord's day, ye Sabbath-breaking niggers.   	        Peter Tanner prided himself upon his strict religious observances he was a deacon in the church.  	        But I have now reached a point in the progress of my narrative, when it becomes necessary to turn away from these light descriptions, to the more grave and weighty matter of the second battle with Master Tibeats, and the flight through the great Pacoudrie Swamp.       
      stay with me sometimes until 2 or 3 o'clock P. M., and learn me to cypher to the single rule of three.             I arrived at Hartford on the 15th of Nov., 1835. Since that time some of my good white friends have assisted me by referring me to good books, and giving good instruction, of which I have reason to believe some of them are in heaven, and others on earth doing good.             My mother's and father's theology, or the way we children were taught by our parents, neither of them could read; but as mother's master was a member of the M. E. church, and used to read the Bible to his slaves--not learn nor teach them to read, but read the Bible to them.             First, man is a compound being, possessing two natures, a soul and a body; the body is of the earth, and must die and return to the dust from whence it came; but the soul is immortal; that is, will never die, but will live forever           in happiness with God, or exist in hell for ever. This theology teaches of two places for the souls of the human family after death, and the condition by which they must go first. If children were obedient to their parents or their owners, and prayed to the Lord to forgive them of their sins and make them good children, and keep them from telling lies, from stealing, from taking the Lord's name in vain, and to keep the Sabbath holy. But above all, never to be saucy to old people, lest our case should be like the forty-two children destroyed by the two she bears--II KINGS, chap. 2-23: And he went up from thence unto Bethel, and as he was going up by the way there came forth little children out of the city and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou head, go up thou bald head. Verse 24: and he turned back and looked on them and cursed them in the name of the Lord; and there came forth two she-bears out of the wood and tore           forty and two children of them. And I am glad to know that even from the most oppressed slave to the most refined white family's children at the south, are taught to respect the old, white or black. Their children call old colored people aunt and uncle by way of respect. None use the word 'nigger' but the low and vulgar.             Our family theology teaches that God is no respecter of persons, but gave his son to die for all, bond or free, black or white, rich or poor. If we keep his commandments, we will be happy after death. It also teaches that if God calls and sanctifies a person to do some great work, that person is immortal until his work is done; that God is able and will protect him from all danger or accident in life if he is faithful to his calling or charge committed by the Lord. This is a borrowed idea from circumstances too numerous to mention. Here, is one man we present as a proof of the     
     tink about Jesus Christ, and wish to be like him.               Can you read?               A little.               Who taught you to read?               God teach me to read.               What do you mean by saying so?               God give me desire to read, and dat make reading easy. Massa give me Bible, and one sailor show me de letters; and so me learned to read by myself, with God's goot help.               And what do you read in the Bible?               O! me read all about Jesus Christ, and how he loved sinners; and wicked men killed him, and he died, and came again from the grave, and all dis for negro. And it sometime make me cry, to tink dat Christ love so poor negro.               And what do the people say about your reading and praying, and attention to the things of God?               Some wicked people dat do not love Jesus Christ, call me great fool, and negro dog, and black hypocrite. And dat make me sometime feel angry: but den me remember Christian must not be angry for dat. Jesus Christ was called ugly black names, and he was quiet as a lamb; and den me remember Jesus Christ, and me say noting again to dem.       
             Copied from imagination's parchment roll, where this, and  many other things, have been on perpetual record from childhood.  Ficticious, as it is, and as ridiculous as it may appear,  I defy any minister, white or black, who preaches to the slaves  in the south, to preach any better doctrines and have his  preaching harmonize with the institution of slavery. The  whole sentiment is consistent with slavery, and the old experienced  southerner will read many things in this discourse  which he has heard before. This is preached more generally  on the Sabbath, previous to the usual holidays by the   Rt. Rev. Bishop Policy.              Well, darkies, I am happy to see so many shining eyes,  and greasy faces today. It speaks two great truths; first, that  you are all awake to your own welfare; and secondly, that  your masters treated you well and gave you meat. You have  come out today to hear the word of God. I hope you will  pay strict attention to what is said, and treasure it up in good  and honest hearts. My text is not taken directly from the  Bible, that is, not our Bible, but yours. We all respect your  Bible more than we do the white man's Bible, or otherwise  the word of God, for your Bible you can obey, but ours you  cannot. The text is recorded in the laws of Maryland, A.  D. 1715, Chapter 44, Section 22.  All negroes and other          slaves already imported, or hereafter to be imported into this  province, and all children born, or hereafter to be born of  such negroes and slaves, shall be slaves during their natural  lives.  In the first place, I shall show God's wisdom displayed  in the system of slavery. Second, the master's great  responsibility. Third and last, the consequence of disobedience.  God's wisdom is displayed in the system of  slavery. The text declares positively that you shall all be  slaves during your natural lives. What a great blessing God  has brought to you, my colored friends, through the economy  of His divine grace. A greater blessing never was conferred  on mortals. From the birth of Adam until the present day  we are taught in our Bible that God wrought miracles upon  the Egyptians  -  brought the children of Israel over the Red  Sea  -  preserved them in the wilderness in safety. But by  and by they entered into the land of Canaan, a land of  freedom, and immediately they began to have trouble and  discord. But you, my colored friends, have been prepared   with a perpetual home through life. You are as trees planted  by the river of waters, whose branches fail not. O that you  might praise the Lord for his goodness and for His wonderful  works toward you black people.           Again, God's wisdom is displayed in the institution of  slavery, in its great plan of perpetuating the negro race.   The white men, the masterpiece of God's creation.  when  tracing nature through various windings, while the good Samaritans  were seeking upon the face of God's earth for  objects of pity and compassion, somehow, very mysteriously,  were wafted by the kind breezes of heaven to the burning  shores of Africa. There they found the sooty tribes of  that hot climate very much degraded. At first they scarcely  knew what to call them; they so much resembled the orangoutang          as to cause a great controversy among God's people.  Finally they were seen to bow with reverence and adore an  image of their own making. Again, they were seen warring,  slaying and eating each other, and sacrificing one another by  thousands to their deities.            This disposition was so much like that of the low class of  whites that they felt the spirit of pity and compassion move  towards those poor God forsaken creatures, and a plan  was immediately formed for their protection and elevation.  They were at once taken on board ship, kindly treated,  and safely brought to America, where they were put in the  care of kind men who provided for them, clothed and fed  them, and comforted them in sickness and in health. And  here you have been until the present day. Now you can see   what God has done for you in instituting this system of  slavery. You were found an ignorant set, no top on your  heads  -  and it is doubtful whether you had any soul  -  more  than the apes that played around you. But through the  economy of God's grace you have been transplanted upon  American soil, and through much toil on the part of the  white man, you are becoming quite intelligent. The white  man, through amalgamation, has not only imparted to you  his straight hair, high nose, blue eyes, thin lips and perfect  form, but it is to be hoped that you have a soul much resembling  his, which will, by his care and attention, and your  obedience to his precepts, stand a great chance to be admitted  upon the ground floor of God's glorious temple in  heaven  -  this is better than a thousand lives in Africa, and  who would despise his chains, which are but for a moment,  and then passeth away  -  for the blessings which flow out of  the system of slavery. The text declares that you shall be  slaves your natural lives, which may signify that it is your          nature to be slaves. That is, that you are created to be servants  of the white man, and all the children to be born of  you are to be slaves. Yes, Susan, that little blue-eyed boy  you are now trotting upon your knee  -  the express  image of his young master Thomas, is to be a slave, and  should you ever see the least disposition of his young master  exciting his aspirations to freedom, you must crush that disposition  immediately, and repeat to him the language of the  text.            Again God's wisdom is displayed in making you with  strong constitutions. See what large, robust, fat, greasy  looking fellows you all are. See what clear, white teeth you  have. Just look at me. See what a puny, slender, delicate,  pale looking creature I am, my teeth all decayed. I could  not crack parched corn and cotton seeds and get fat like you  all do. If I should take a hoe or pitchfork in my hands they  would be soiled, and if I should work an hour they would be  blistered so badly that I could not correct a slave again for a  month. Just look at my hand now. The other day I took  hold of a rough cowhide without my gloves on, and gave a  young impudent wench, who told my wife something, forty  lashes, and it raised this great blister you see. I was never  made to work. Look at those great, broad-sided, good,  healthy looking wenches sitting before me. What arms they  have. Any of them can work from daylight until dark in  the field, when the sun is so hot that the overseer has to ride  under an umbrella, and your mistress would almost faint just  walking out in the garden. Thus, you can plainly see that  God has not made the white man to work. He is only to  think, plead law, make laws, preach, pray, and carry the gospel  to the heathen, and superintend God's works, while the  blacks were made to do the hard and dirty work. For this          they hard constitutions peculiarly adapted. But again; God's  wisdom is further displayed in the economy of slavery by  creating you void of natural affections, as regards family  sociability, and maternal and parental love for your husbands,  wives and children. Therefore, our conscience is void of offense  toward God or you negroes, when we separate the husbands  from their wives and children, for it is for the purpose  of rearing up fine temples for the glory of God and his Kingdom.            
      who was a white man; the law making it necessary that white persons should be present at all assemblages of slaves or free negroes. The object of all the slaveholders in having their slaves go to church can be clearly seen by the following sermon, which, or one very similar to it, I recollect hearing while worshipping at this church, which has been published and circulated quite extensively at the South:--  'All things whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so unto them:' That is, do by all mankind just as you would desire they should do by you if you were in their place, and they in yours. Now, to suit this rule to your particular circumstances: suppose you were masters and mistresses, and had servants under you; would you not desire that your servants should do their business faithfully and honestly, as well when your back was turned as while you were looking over them? Would you not expect that they should take notice of what you said to them; that they should behave themselves with respect towards you and yours; and be as careful of everything belonging to you, as you would be yourself? You are servants; do, therefore, as you wish to be done by, and you will be both good servants to your masters and to your God, who requires this of you, and will reward you well for it, if you do it for the sake of conscience, in obedience to his commands. Take care that you do not fret, or murmur, or grumble at your condition, for this will not only make your life uneasy, but will greatly offend Almighty God. Consider, this it is not yourselves; it is not the people you belong to; it is not the men that have brought you to it; but it is the will of God, who hath by wise providence made you servants, because,           no doubt, he knew that condition would be best for you in this world and help you the better toward heaven, if you would but do your duty in it; so that any discontent at your not being free, or rich, or great as some others, is quarrelling with your Heavenly Master, and finding fault with God himself. There is only one circumstance which may appear grievous; that I shall now take notice of,--and that is, correction. Now, let us see what the Scriptures say on this point. 'The servant that knoweth his master's will and doeth it not, shall be beaten with many stripes.' Now, does this not apply directly to yourselves? Now, when correction is given to you, you either deserve it, or you do not deserve it; but, whether you really deserve it or not, it is your duty, and Almighty God requires, that you bear it patiently. You may perhaps think that this is hard doctrine; but if you consider right, you must needs think otherwise of it. Suppose, then, that you deserve correction, you cannot but say that it is right and just you should meet with it. Suppose, then, that you deserve correction, you cannot but say that it is right and just you should meet with it. Suppose you do not deserve it, or at least do not deserve so much punishment for the fault you have committed, you perhaps have escaped a great many more, and are at last paid for all. Or, suppose you are quite innocent of what is laid to your charge, and suffer wrongfully in that particular thing; is it not possible you may have done some other bad thing, which was never discovered, and that Almighty God, who saw you doing it, would not let you escape without punishment some time or another? and ought you not in such a case to give glory to him, and be thankful that he would rather punish you in this world for your wickedness than destroy your souls for it in the next? But, suppose that this even was not the            case,--a case hardly to be imagined; and that you have by no means, known or unknown, deserved the correction you have received, there is this great comfort in it, that if you bear it patiently and leave your cause in your hands of God, he will reward you for it in heaven; and this punishment you suffer unjustly here, shall turn to your exceeding great glory hereafter.              Such, my readers, is the doctrine which is preached to the poor slave; and I could add many more specimens of it, if space would permit. They are made to believe that God made them slaves, that they are always to remain slaves, and bear with patience and humility the unjust punishment they receive on earth, that it may be to their glory hereafter. Is it not an unpardonable sin for man thus to defile the holy sanctuary, and pollute the sacred word of God by using it for such base purposes? But comment is unnecessary; the diabolical facts show fairly enough of themselves, without my attempting to bring them out any more. The cut represents a number of slaves listening to preaching of this kind.      
   they go to gambling and cockfighting. Aaron's old master and mistress owned eight slaves, and among them was three females. They had to take night about and sit up all night to fan their master and mistress, to keep them cool, after working and toiling all day. Aaron says that if you females remember your brother in bonds as though you were bound with them, and will try to do all that is in your power to deliver them from that sinful indolent life, I long to see the day when the white people live at the South as they do at the North; not debar the poor African who has to toil out under the hot boiling sun, and depriving them of everything that is just and right in the sight of a holy God.           Aaron thinks according to the reading of the Bible, that God foreknew everything, God Almighty saw that Pharaoh was determined to keep the children of Israel in bondage. God taught such a time that they should keep them in bondage and that time was four hundred years and no longer. If it was right for the Egyptians to hold the Israelites in bonds, the Lord would not have brought them out. Did not the Lord say that he would bring out the Israelites, and bring the Egyptians to judgment. God sent Moses and Aaron to deliver them, and they were something like twenty or thirty years about it, and it seemed that Pharaoh was determined to hold the Israelites in bonds, the devil made a complete fool of Pharaoh, so that he was swallowed up in water and woke in hell. Pharaoh, he bound the chains tighter and tighter around the Israelites. The poor wicked slaveholder that is living now upon the face of the earth, does not know his right hand from his left in bringing the chains tighter and tighter upon the poor slave at the south, and Aaron is afraid that they will not hearken to justice until the Lord sinks them in sin and folly in the same way he did the wicked Pharaoh. God had a foreview of the white man holding the African in bonds, according to the reading of the Bible, because he says, you may go and buy of the heathen, and they shall serve you forever; and they shall be inherited to your children forever: that is, if your hearts are wicked and bad enough to do so,--but remember after death God will bring you into judgment. We must take the bible as it reads, and it is a bitter guide against slavery, if it was not a bitter guide against slavery why does it say in so many different places,  thou shalt not hold thy fellow mortal in bondage.  The slaveholders can't see to read the bible, because their hearts are shut up with sin and iniquity, and is stained with the African's blood. When every man is dipped in the blood of Christ, he is a new creature in Christ Jesus, then he can see to read God's holy word, and he will not read it and say it is right to hold his fellow mortal in servitude, and traffic in his own flesh and blood. Any man blessed with moral principles will not stand up and justify slavery and say that it is right. Now we just as well might say that        it was right for God Almighty to send down his holy Son from above for the wicked Jews to put to death. God Almighty sent his holy Son down from above to preach to the people to tell them the way to fly from iniquity and be saved in his holy kingdom, but the Jews were very wicked and bad like the people now-a-days, they took the holy Lamb and  slayed  him. God Almighty blessed the Jews with the power, and he blessed them with the strength, but he did not bless them in the heart with that wicked bad deed. Who was it blessed them with that wicked bad deed? Aaron thinks it was the devil that blessed them with that wicked bad deed, else they would not have taken that holy lamb from above and put him to death. Aaron thinks all the Jews that condemned Christ is now numbered among the damned in hell and always will be there until the end of time. All the horrors and iniquity of slavery Aaron has seen in the State of Maryland and in the State of Kentucky, and in the State of old Virginia. Aaron says they do not raise rice there, they do not raise cotton there, this all grows in South Carolina and Georgia. Aaron says that in the last of December they fetch up sugar and molasses, they fetch up rice and cotton, and trade it off in old Virginia for little black boys and girls, between 6 and 7 years old, and take them down into South Carolina and Georgia, and sell them and get the money for them, and put the money in their pockets. Poor mothers are robbed of their dear little children, and there is not ethram nor anthema said about it. Aaron's views upon half-hearted Christian people standing up in the eyes of their brethren and sisters, and not only in their eyes but in the eyes of a holy God too, and justifying slavery and saying it is right.            Aaron, how did you feel and fare, for about the first week after you left your master?           O good man, after I and tother slave that come with me took start away from our master, for more than one week, I suffered dreadfully, so I did, cause I all the time did think master's overseers was close my heel behind to catch me, and I liked most starved to death, so I did,--for after I got into Ohio State with nothing with me to eat, and you know I was afraid to stop at the houses where folks was, to beg; so afraid some enemy would catch me, you know, and run me back to master; which I dreaded that most like death itself, so I did.           And dear man, how I lived I don't know, for as true as-you live, I had to creep when it was dark to get where folks did keep their stuff for the hogs to eat, and did eat the very swill, so I did, not as we read the Prodigal Son did in the Bible, because he left his father's nice home; but because I was going to get that freedom which God blessed me, to get that freedom which you white folks have; and don't think much about it. Your white folks tell a good deal about this nation's liberty the fourth of July.     
     But, I tell you, I believe there is only two places for us--heaven and torment. If we miss heaven we must be forever lost.               Yes, Aunt Charlotte, that's the teaching of the Bible.               Aunt Jane used to tell us, too, that the children of Israel was in Egypt in bondage, and that God delivered them out of Egypt; and she said he would deliver us. We all used to sing a hymn like this:        'My God delivered Daniel, Daniel, Daniel;            O, you ought to hear Richard sing that hymn! I never can forget Aunt Jane, for when old marster used to be so hard on me it seemed I'd have to give up sometimes and die. But then the Spirit of God would come to me and fill my heart with joy. It seemed the more trials I had the more I could pray.               Aunt Charlotte, you remind me of Pilgrim's Progress.               Yes, I remember about Pilgrim traveling     
      bidder, to be transported to a distant part of the country, leaving the dearest relatives behind; to be, in fine, ground down mentally and physically by the untold curses of slavery, may be a very pretty thing to the masters of the  peculiar institution,  but it is death to the slaves.             After more than twenty years of bondage, God delivered me from it, with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, as he did Israel of old.             As near as I can remember, my mother and sister were sold and taken to New Orleans, leaving four brothers and myself behind. We were all placed out. At six years of age I was placed with a Mr. Bradford, separated from my father, mother and family. But the eye of God was upon me, and blessed me. My master was a carpenter, and much from home--Mrs. Bradford beat me so much that her husband sent me to his father's. Mrs. Bradford ordered me one day to take a bushel of corn up stairs; but     
               My dear breethering, the Lord raised up his servant, Moses, that he should fetch his people Isrel up outen that wicked land--ah. Then Moses, he went out from the face of the Lord, and departed hence unto the courts of the old tyranickle king--ah. An' what sez you, Moses? Ah, sez he, Moses sez, sez he to that wicked old Faro: Thus sez the Lord God of hosts, sez he: Let my Isrel go  --ah. An' what sez the ole, hard-hearted king--ah? Ah! sez Faro, sez he, who is the Lord God of hosts, sez he, that I should obey his voice--ah? An' now what sez you, Moses--ah. Ah, Moses sez, sez he: Thus saith the Lord God of Isrel, let my people go, that they mought worship me, sez the Lord, in the wilderness--ah. But--ah! my beloved breethering an' my harden', impenitent frien's--ah, did the ole, hard-hearted king harken to the words of Moses, and let my people go--ah? Nary time.             This last remark, made in an ordinary, conversational tone of voice, was so sudden and unexpected that the change, the transition from the singing state was electrical.             An' then, my beloved breethering an' sistering, what next --ah? What sez you, Moses, to Faro--that contrary ole king--ah? Ah, Moses sez to Faro, sez he, Moses sez, sez he: Thus seth the Lord God of Isrel: Let my people go, sez the Lord, leest I come, sez he, and smite you with a cuss--ah! An' what sez Faro, the ole tyranickle king--ah? Ah, sez he, sez ole Faro, Let their tasks be doubled,         and leest they mought grumble, sez he, those bricks shall be made without straw -- ah! [Vox naturale.] Made 'em pluck up grass an' stubble outen the fields, breethering, to mix with their mud. Mity hard on the pore critters; warn't it, Brother Flood Gate?  [The individual thus interrogated replied,  Jess so;  and  ole Louder  moved along.]             An' what next--ah? Did the ole king let my people Isrel go--ah? No, my dear breethering, he retched out his pizen hand, and he hilt 'em fash--ah. Then the Lord was wroth with that wicked ole king--ah. An' the Lord, he sed to Moses, sez he: Moses, stretch forth now thy rod over the rivers an' the ponds of this wicked land--ah; an' behold, sez he, when thou stretch out thy rod, sez the Lord, all the waters shall be turned into blood--ah! Then Moses, he tuck his rod, an' he done as the Lord God of Isrel had commanded his servant Moses to do--ah. An' what then, say you, my breethering--ah? Why, lo an' behold! the rivers of that wicked land was all turned into blood--ah; an' all the fish an' all the frogs in them streams an' waters died a--h!               Yes!  said the speaker, lowering his voice to a natural tone, and glancing out of the open window at the dry and dusty road, for we were at the time suffering from a protracted drouth:  An' I believe the frogs will all die now, unless we get some rain purty soon. What do you think about it, Brother Waters?  [This interrogatory was addressed to a fine, portly-looking old man in the congregation. Brother W. nodded assent, and old Louder resumed         the thread of his discourse.]  Ah, my beloved breethering, that was a hard time on old Faro an' his wicked crowd--ah. For the waters was loathsome       REV. MR. WILSON AND HIS CAPTURED SLAVE.--    king obey the voice of the Lord, and let my people Isrel go--ah? Ah, no, my breethering, not by a long sight--ah. For he hilt out agin the Lord, and obeyed not his voice--ah. Then the Lord sent a gang of bull-frogs into that wicked land--ah. An' they went hoppin' an' lopin' about all over the country, into the vittles, an' everywhere else--ah. My breethering, the old Louder thinks that was a des'prit time--ah. But all woodent do--ah. Ole Faro was as stubborn as one of Louder's mules--ah, an' he woodent let the chosen seed go up outen the land of bondage--ah. Then the Lord sent a mighty hail, an', arter that, his devourin' locuses--ah! An' they et up blamed nigh everything on the face of the eth--ah.              Let not yore harts be trubbled, for the truth is mitay and must prevale--ah. Brother Creek, you don't seem to be doin' much of ennything, suppose you raise a tune!             This remark was addressed to a tall, lank, hollow-jawed old man, in the congregation, with a great shock of  grizzled gray  hair.             Wait a minit, Brother Louder, till I git on my glasses!  was the reply of Brother Creek, who proceeded to draw from his pocket an oblong tin case, which opened and shut with a tremendous snap, from which he drew a pair of iron-rimmed spectacles. These he carefully  dusted  with his handkerchief, and then turned to the hymn which the preacher had selected and read out to the congregation. After considerable deliberation, and some     
    master's, Mr. Oliver Sturges, who came from Fairfield, Connecticut. He bought me to drive his carriage. A new coachman's dress, which he gave me, would have felt much better, if it had not been for the large blister, that had been drawn upon my side. However, I rode down by my old master's, and cracked my whip with as much pride, spirit and activity, as one of Uncle Sam's Mail carriers, who drives four horses, on a general post road, drunk or sober. My old master happening to see me pass in this manner, was very much chagrined, to think he had sold me under the impression that I was just ready to die. He called his wife to the window, and complained to her, that she had urged him to sell me, and swore, and cursed outrageously. I was now under my sixth master, Mr. Sturges, who bought me from the Jew. Mr. Sturges, was a very kind master, but exceedingly severe when angry. He had a new negro, by the name of Cato, with whom I got a fighting, and bit off his nose, just as my master was going to sell him, which injured the sale of Cato, very much. For this I had to beg very hard to escape being whipped. I went to the fortune tellers, who told me that my master said, that if he should take me on with him to New York, I should be free: so I knew that I should not go with him. I had always been in the habit of praying, ever since I knew what it meant; and whenever I went to church, to drive the carriage, I used to stand upon the steps, and listen to the preaching. About this time, I began to realize that I was a sinner, and that hell would be my portion if I should die in my present situation: and afterwards while I was living with Doct. Collock, and under the advice of the Rev. Mr. Collock, whose voice and preaching, harrowed up my soul with awful apprehensions, I sought and obtained the hope of salvation. Blessed be God, I know the path to heaven. I have had sweet communion with the Lord; but alas! I have erred, and gone astray from holiness.            My conscience used sometimes to upbraid me with having done wrong, after I had run away from my master and arrived in Connecticut; and while I was living in Southington, Conn. (where I spent some time, as will afterwards be told) I went up on a high mountain, and prayed to the Lord, to teach me my duty, that I might know whether or not I ought to go back to my master. Before I came down I felt satisfied, and it did seem to me that the Lord heard my prayers, when I was a poor wretched slave, and delivered me out of the land of Egypt, and out of the          house of bondage; and that it was his hand, and not my own artfulness and cunning, which had enabled me to escape: therefore if we trust in God, we need have no fear of the greatest trials; and though my heart has been pierced with sufferings keen as death, and drank from the cup of slavery, the bitterest dregs ever mingled in it; yet under the consolations of religion, my fortitude never left me.            As Mr. Sturges was intending to remove to New-York, he sold out all his property, and every thing he could wish to part with. He talked very strong of taking me on with him to New-York, but after consideration altered his mind, and hired me out to a Mr. Wolhopter, a printer in Savannah. I lived with Mr. Wolhopter all that summer, and drove his horses and carriages all about there, and out to White Bluff, where he had hired a seat for the summer, supposing it to be a healthy situation, which indeed it was; but we were tormented with  moschetos  and such other insects as infest that country (called by different names) to a great degree, so that we could hardly sleep nights. We were alternately at this place and at Savannah for the space of four or five months. At the expiration of that time, Mr. Wolhopter removed back to Savannah, with his family, and I accompanied them. I will here mention that during the time I resided at White Bluff, at the request of Mr. Wolhopter, I often went a fishing, and the rays of the sun beating down more severe there, than where I had formerly lived, it created an ague and fever, which reduced me so low that even my attending physician, Doct. Collock (who attended me strictly for about four months)  dispaired  of my life, and often since that time being borne down under the afflictions that a slave often experiences, and indeed too often, I have wished his predictions had proved true. But after Doct. Collock perceived I was convalescent, and gaining my health and strength rapidly, he enquired of me, that provided he should buy me, if I would be contented to live with him; drive his horses and carriage, occasionally wait in the house and at the table, and do such other business as is necessarily required in a family.            With but few remarks I endeavour to give my readers but a faint representation of the hard treatment, ill usage and horrid abuse the poor slave experiences while groaning under the yoke of bondage; that yoke which is not easy, nor the burden light; but being placed in that situation, to repine is useless, we must submit to our fate and bear up as well as we can under the cruel treatment of our      
             My smile is but the death of harm,           Whilst riding on the wind,           My power restrains the thunder's arm,           Which dies in chains confined.           After having read the  travel of Israel from Egypt to the Red Red Sea, where they triumphantly  arrive on the opposite bank, I was excited to compose the following few lines:             Sing, O ye ransom'd, shout and tell           What God has done for ye;           The horses and their riders fell          And perish'd in the sea.            Look back, the vain Egyptian dies           Whilst plunging from the shore;           He groans, he sinks, but not to rise,           King Pharaoh is no more.            Many other pieces did I compose, which have long since slipped my recollection, and some perhaps better than those before you. During this mental conflict no person was apprised  of my views except my brother, who rather surmised it, being often in converse with me, and who was equally emulous for literatures and strove to rival me. Though     
      the heaviest kind,--compelled to move heavy trunks and boxes,-- many times to wash till ten and twelve o'clock at night. There were three deaths in the family while I remained there, and the entire burden was put upon me. I often felt to exclaim as the Children of Israel did:  O Lord, my burden is greater than I can bear.  I was then seventeen years of age. My health has been impaired from that time to the present. I have a severe pain in my side by the slightest over exertion. In the Winter I suffer intensely with cold, and cannot get warm unless in a room heated to eighty degrees. I am infirm and burdened with the influence of slavery, whose impress will ever remain on my mind and body. For six months I tried to make my escape. I used to rise at four o'clock in the morning to find some one to assist me, and at last I succeeded. I was allowed two hours once in two weeks to go and return three miles. I could  contrive no other way than to improve one of those opportunities, in which I was finally successful. I became acquainted with some persons who assisted slaves to escape by the underground railroad. They were colored people .  I was to pretend going to church, and the man who was to assist and introduce me to the proper parties was to linger on the street opposite the house, and I was to follow at a short distance. On Sunday evening I begged leave to attend church, which was reluctantly granted if I completed all my work, which was no easy task. It appeared as if my mistress used every possible exertion to delay me from church, and I concluded that her old cloven-footed companion had impressed his intentions on her mind. Finally, when I was ready to start, my mistress took a notion to go out to ride, and desired me to dress her little boy, and then get ready for church. Extensive hoops were then worn, and as I had attached my whole wardrobe under mine by a cord around my waist, it required considerable dexterity and no small amount of maneuvering  to hide the fact from my mistress. While attending to the child I had managed to stand in one corner of the room, for fear she might come in contact with me, and thus discover that     
      Governor his opinion about the matter. He told them it was  a very good thing if I could come out in it; but he said it  was a mighty big undertaking. They called meetings for two  years, until they got ashamed, and the white peopled  laughed at them and said what big fools they were. They  went so far as to have my name printed and circulated all  over the city, saying that I was a fraud, and I never would  build an institution, because they had not authorized me to  build it. They said to build a non-sectarian institution I  would have to go to the President of the United States and  get license to build a school of that character.             The leading white people of the city told me to have them  prosecuted for circulating such a paper against me without  any foundation. None of them had given a dollar for the  institution.             I laughed when I chanced to hear what they would say,  because I knew that they were very ignorant; I knew that  God had chosen some one to lead the Israelites out of  Egypt, and I had begun to think that He had chosen your  humble servant to lead those ignorant people out of the  second Egypt. One of the ablest lawyers in the city of  Raleigh told me if I said so he would put the last one of  them in the work house. I remember I repeated these words  to Judge Strong, and told him I believed in what Davy  Crockett said,     
    it may kill the body, but it cannot kill the soul, because of the blood of Christ. So much, then, for having the mind of Christ. Let all seek to have the mind changed, that we may be led by the Spirit of Christ. In order to be led by the Spirit of Christ, we must be born again; born of that spirit that can lead us from earth to that blessed world of rest, that remains for the people of God.            Come, friends, don't read, and do no more. You must make the inquiry, how stands the case between God Almighty and your soul; and endeavor to receive the Spirit of Christ, that you may be a lively stone in the building, meet for the master's use, cleansed by his blood! A lively stone in the building? We must live godly and soberly in Christ Jesus the Lord, which is your salvation.            Now, I leave this part in your minds, till I look over the world of mankind, and see how many there are that will take heed to their way, and come up unitedly to serve the Lord with one accord, and be the people God wants them to be. For he says,  Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.  Look, now, and see if you are making any exertion in this matter. God  has said it, and you must do it, and do it unitedly; for he judges Israel, and kill them that would not obey. O, Ethiopia, have you obeyed the voice of God Almighty, that spoke by the voice of thunder, to the Israelites on the Mount Sinai? They saw          the cloud, and heard the thunder so loud, that they feared to stand near, but told Moses to go and speak to God; and all that God told him they should do, did they do it? No, but still rebelled against the man of God, and refused to take the counsel that God gave to Moses for them. For this, the Lord's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until the generation that had done evil in the sight of the Lord was consumed. Then be not an evil doer, lest thou share the same fate. Many things that we do can be let alone; do you believe it? then let alone evil practices; the mind must be changed before you can be saved.  The Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take of the water of life freely. --Rev. xxii. 17.            I have heard some people say that at God's own appointed time he would bring all these things to pass that we have been speaking about. Friends, let me tell you the truth, and you believe it, God's time is when you get right and do right. God ever has worked in this way with the nations of the earth, so you need not to think of living in your laziness, never  asking God to help and bless you and your family, but still say that God will do all at his appointed time. That appointed time is now, this day. God told Noah to build the ark, and he went to work and built it. The same God      has told you to repent of your sins. Have you done so? The same God told Israel what they had to do before they left Egypt. Were they obedient to God's word or not? God does not bless men in disobedience. In order that we may receive strength from the Lord our God, we must be obedient to him as the Governor of the universe. Whatever he bids us do hasten so to do, as obedient children, and not set on the stool of do nothing saying, that God in his own appointed time will bring all things to pass as though he did not require any thing of you at all. My friend, if you look at it just as it is, God has laid the foundation and you are the builders. Now tell me what are you waiting for? God has done his work in laying the foundation and tells you to build on the foundation:  for other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.  1 Cor. iii. 11. God requires to use all the means in our power to bring peace and union, that God's name may be glorified here on the earth. How are men to build on the foundation that God has laid? They should  seek, first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.  Matthew vi. 33. Then God looks for your work. You are not your own, you are bought with a price, and of course have to work for him that bought you with his own precious blood. He redeemed us for himself.

AN   ADDRESS   TO ALL THE   COLORED CITIZENS   OF THE    UNITED STATES.    BY   JOHN B. MEACHUM,   PASTOR OF THE AFRICAN BAPTIST CHURCH, ST. LOUIS, MO.      Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.--PSALM 68, 31.   PHILADELPHIA:   PRINTED FOR THE AUTHOR,   BY KING AND BAIRD.   1846.          
               The blood of men, women and babes cries unto God from Texas to Maine. Wherever the Fugitive Slave Law reaches, the voice of its victims is heard.             The mighty God, the great Jehovah, speaks to the consciences of men, and says,  LET MY PEOPLE GO FREE!  And the slaveholder answers,  Who is Jehovah, that we should obey him?  Then the Anti-Slavery voice is heard, calling,  Awake!  AWAKE! and cry aloud against this great evil; lift up your voice like a trumpet, and show the people their sins, and the nation its guilt. Pray that God may have mercy upon us. O, forgive us this great evil,--the evil of selling, whipping, and killing men, women and children! O, God of justice! give us hearts and consciences to feel the deep sorrows of this great evil that we have so long indulged in! Lo! we have sinned against Heaven; we have sinned against light,--against the civilized world. We have sinned against that declaration which our fathers put forth to the world,   All men are created equal.               O God! forgive us this great sin! O let this prayer be heard!       
   come after my nigger.  My sister screamed and started for the back door, but some one was there to catch her. We children cried and our mother begged and prayed but our sister was taken back and they put a ball and chain on her and kept her chained down until she was subdued and would run away no more. But in a few days she was back again; this time mother ran with her to some Union sympathizer near by, and they kept her until the Proclamation was issued.           When the glad tidings came that we were freed, and the war was over, such rejoicing and weeping and shouting among the slaves was never heard before, unless it was the time that the Ark of the Covenant was brought back to the children of Israel. Great numbers of the slaves left their masters immediately. They had no shelter, but they dug holes in the ground, made dug-outs, brush houses, with a piece of board here and there, whenever they could find one, until finally they had a little village called  Dink-town,  looking more like an Indian village than anything else. There they sang and prayed and rejoiced. Later on, the soldiers began to come through, returning from the war. They brought many negroes with them who were searching for members of their families. I remember my mother, with me holding on to her skirts, standing watching the soldiers as they passed in their blue suits, and the colored people all shouting  Hurrah for Marse Abe,  and cheering the Union boys as they passed. That was a glad day. That certainly was a year of jubilee for the poor black slave. They had heard about the Liberation from Bondage of the Children of Israel from the Egyptians        and their prayers were always to the Almighty God, and the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob that they too some day might be delivered, and now it had actually come. Oh! what joy!           My father was the only colored man that could write. Slaves were not allowed to learn to read and write, under penalty of flogging, but my father was a house servant and had stolen his education from the young masters as they said over their lessons. He was kept up for hours at night, and sometimes almost all night, writing letters trying to find out where loved ones were. Some had been run south, some were sold away, and they could not tell their names, only the first names. Mothers were hunting children, and husbands hunting wives; they kept my father very busy.           It was also very hard upon the slave owners, as there were none of the white women that knew anything about work, and they were left without a single servant. It was hard for both blacks and whites to become used to the change, for the slaves had no idea how to earn a living. Some of the slaves that had good masters never left, but stayed on the plantations the rest of their lives.           It was not long until my brothers came home and we were all gathered together. Soon after that came the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. That brought great sorrow over all the land, and especially to the blacks. I remember the village of huts where the negroes lived; every one would have a little piece of black cloth hung on it. They could not afford crepe, but it was merely a piece of old black pants, or coat, or anything in order to show their bereavement and        their sorrow, that one so great had been taken from them; they loved him as their friend and deliverer. I heard them speak so much about  Marse Abraham  in their prayers, and sermons, and talk, and about  resting in Abraham's bosom  that I thought for a long time that Abraham Lincoln, and Abraham in the Bible, were the same man, until I began to go to Sunday-school and learned the difference.        
    a pool of blood when the brutal work was ended. His  master congratulated the negro whipping master for  the way he accomplished his part of the work, gave  him another big drink of whiskey and ordered him to  untie the man.           They all went down stairs and the other colored  people who were in the room put the man's clothing  on him. This was late in the afternoon. The next  morning when I awoke I saw the men and women  kneeling around in a circle, praying, groaning and  crying. I walked up and looked to see what the  trouble was, and I found the man they had whipped  the day before cold in death. He was swollen so  that his clothing had. bursted off. A jury of white  men came up and held a mock inquest. I never heard  what the verdict was. The colored men came with a  mule cart, rolled him up in a sheet and took him to  his last resting place.            I stayed in this trader's pen three days after my new  master bought me, and during this time I saw hundreds  of mothers separated from their children. I  heard the wail of many a child for its mother, and of  the mother for her child. While one buyer had the  mother, going in one direction, another with the child  would be going the opposite way. I saw husband and  wife bidding each other farewell and sisters and brothers  being separated. There could not have been any  darker days to them than these; it was with them as it  was with Job, when he spake in the Third Chapter of  Job, and said:             Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the          night in which it is said there is a man child conceived,  let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from  above, neither let the light shine upon it.             Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let  a cloud dwell upon it, let the blackness of the day  terrify it. As for that night, let darkness seize upon  it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it  not come into the number of the months. Lo, let that  night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.  Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to  raise up their mourning. Let the stars of the twilight  thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have  none, neither let it see the dawning of the day; because  it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb,  nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.            These were the lamentations of the poor slaves, but  still they prayed for the dawn and light of a better  day. Like Israel, many looked long and eagerly for freedom  but died without the sight. Thank God, over three  million lived to see the sunlight in all its brilliancy, and  we can now look back and say:  The Lord has done  great things for us, whereof we are glad.         
               Don't talk about dat turkey; he was gone afore we come.              Dis is de las' time I shucks corn at dis farm.              Dis is a cheap farm, cheap owner, an' a cheap supper.              He's talkin' it, ain't he?              Dis is de tuffest meat dat I is been called upon to eat fer many a day; you's got to have teeth sharp as a saw to eat dis meat.              Spose you ain't got no teef, den what you gwine to do?              Why, ef you ain't got no teef you muss  gum it!               Ha, ha, ha!  from the whole company, was heard.            On leaving the corn-shucking farm, each gang of men, headed by their leader, would sing during the entire journey home. Some few, however, having their dogs with them, would start on the trail of a coon, possum, or some other game, which might keep them out till nearly morning.            To the Christmas holidays, the slaves were greatly indebted for winter recreation; for long custom had given to them the whole week from Christmas day to the coming in of the New Year.            On  Poplar Farm,  the hands drew their share of clothing on Christmas day for the year. The clothing for both men and women was made up by women kept for general sewing and housework. One pair of pants, and two shirts, made the entire stock for a male field hand.                    The women's garments were manufactured from the same goods that the men received. Many of the men worked at night for themselves, making splint and corn brooms, baskets, shuck mats, and axe-handles, which they would sell in the city during Christmas week. Each slave was furnished with a pass, something like the following:--                Please let my boy, Jim, pass anywhere in this county, until Jan. 1, 1834, and oblige      Respectfully,      JOHN GAINES, M.D.      'Poplar Farm,' St. Louis County, Mo.               With the above precious document in his pocket, a load of baskets, brooms, mats, and axe-handles on his back, a bag hanging across his shoulders, with a jug in each end,--one for the whiskey, and the other for the molasses,--the slaves trudged off to town at night, singing,--       Hurra, for good ole massa,        When de sun rise in de mornin',                      Both the Methodists and Baptists,--the religious denominations to which the blacks generally belong,--never fail to be in the midst of a revival meeting during the holidays, and, most of the slaves from the country hasten to these gatherings. Some, however, spend their time at the dances, raffles, cock-fights, foot-races, and other amusements that present themselves.     CHAPTER X.            A YOUNG and beautiful lady, closely veiled and attired in black, arrived one morning at  Poplar Farm,  and was shown immediately into a room in the eastern wing, where she remained, attended only by old Nancy. That the lady belonged to the better class was evident from her dress, refined manners, and the inviolable secrecy of her stay at the residence of Dr. Gaines. At last the lady gave birth to a child, which was placed under the care of Isabella, a quadroon servant, who had recently lost a baby of her own.            The lady left the premises as mysteriously as she had come, and nothing more was ever seen or heard of her, certainly not by the negroes. The child, which was evidently of pure Anglo-Saxon blood, was called Lola, and grew up amongst the negro children of the place, to be a bright, pretty girl, to whom her adopted mother seemed very much attached.      
    from it, and the thing was known. One bad sheep will spoil a whole flock. I was a bad sheep. I hated slavery, slaveholders, and all pertaining to them; and I did not fail to inspire others with the same feeling wherever and whenever opportunity was presented. This made me a marked lad among the slaves, and a suspected one among slaveholders. A knowledge also of my ability to read and write got pretty widely spread, which was very much against me.            The days between Christmas day and New Year's were allowed the slaves as holidays. During these days all regular work was suspended, and there was nothing to do but to keep fires and look after the stock. We regarded this time as our own by the grace of our masters, and we therefore used it or abused it as we pleased. Those who had families at a distance were expected to visit them and spend with them the entire week. The younger slaves or the unmarried ones were expected to see to the animals and attend to incidental duties at home. The holidays were variously spent. The sober, thinking, industrious ones would employ themselves in manufacturing corn-brooms, mats, horse-collars, and baskets, and some of these were very well made. Another class spent their time in hunting opossums, coons, rabbits, and other game. But the majority spent the holidays in sports, ball-playing, wrestling, boxing, running, foot-races, dancing, and drinking whisky; and this latter mode was generally most agreeable to their masters. A slave who would work during the holidays was thought by his master undeserving of holidays. There was in this simple act of continued work an accusation against slaves, and a slave could not help thinking that if he made three dollars during the holidays he might make three hundred during the year. Not to be drunk during the holidays was disgraceful.                   The fiddling, dancing, and  jubilee beating  was carried on in all directions. This latter performance was strictly southern. It supplied the place of violin or other musical instruments and was played so easily that almost every farm had its  Juba  beater. The performer improvised as he beat the instrument, marking the words as he sang so as to have them fall pat with the movement of his hands. Once in a while among a mass of nonsense and wild frolic, a sharp hit was given to the meanness of slaveholders. Take the following for example:                                        This is not a bad summary of the palpable injustice and fraud of slavery, giving, as it does, to the lazy and idle the comforts which God designed should be given solely to the honest laborer. But to the holidays. Judging from my own observation and experience, I believe those holidays were among the most effective means in the hands of slaveholders of keeping down the spirit of insurrection among the slaves.            To enslave men successfully and safely it is necessary to keep their minds occupied with thoughts and aspirations short of the liberty of which they are deprived. A certain degree of attainable good must be kept before them. These holidays served the purpose of keeping the minds of the slaves occupied with prospective pleasure within the limits of slavery. The young man could go          wooing, the married man to see his wife, the father and mother to see their children, the industrious and money-loving could make a few dollars, the great wrestler could win laurels, the young people meet and enjoy each other's society, the drinking man could get plenty of whisky, and the religious man could hold prayer-meetings, preach, pray, and exhort. Before the holidays there were pleasures in prospect; after the holidays they were pleasures of memory, and they served to keep out thoughts and wishes of a more dangerous character. These holidays were also used as conductors or safety-valves, to carry off the explosive elements inseparable from the human mind when reduced to the condition of slavery. But for these the rigors of bondage would have become too severe for endurance, and the slave would have been forced to a dangerous desperation.            Thus they became a part and parcel of the gross wrongs and inhumanity of slavery. Ostensibly they were institutions of benevolence designed to mitigate the rigors of slave-life, but practically they were a fraud instituted by human selfishness, the better to secure the ends of injustice and oppression. Not the slave's happiness but the master's safety, was the end sought. It was not from a generous unconcern for the slave's labor, but from a prudent regard for the slave system. I am strengthened in this opinion from the fact that most slaveholders liked to have their slaves spend the holidays in such manner as to be of no real benefit to them. Everything like rational enjoyment was frowned upon, and only those wild and low sports peculiar to semi-civilized people were encouraged. The license allowed appeared to have no other object than to disgust the slaves with their temporary freedom, and to make them as glad to return to their work as they had been to leave it. I have known slaveholders resort to cunning tricks, with a view of getting their          slaves deplorably drunk. The usual plan was to make bets on a slave that he could drink more whisky than any other, and so induce a rivalry among them for the mastery in this degradation. The scenes brought about in this way were often scandalous and loathsome in the extreme. Whole multitudes might be found stretched out in brutal drunkenness, at once helpless and disgusting. Thus, when the slave asked for hours of  virtuous liberty,  his cunning master took advantage of his ignorance and cheered him with a dose of vicious and revolting dissipation artfully labeled with the name of   liberty.              We were induced to drink, I among the rest, and when the holidays were over we all staggered up from our filth and wallowing, took a long breath, and went away to our various fields of work, feeling, upon the whole, rather glad to go from that which our masters had artfully deceived us into the belief was freedom, back again to the arms of slavery. It was not what we had taken it to be, nor what it would have been, had it not been abused by us. It was about as well to be a slave to master, as to be a slave to whisky and rum. When the slave was drunk the slaveholder had no fear that he would plan an insurrection, or that he would escape to the North. It was the sober, thoughtful slave who was dangerous and needed the vigilance of his master to keep him a slave.            On the first of January, 1835, I proceeded from St. Michaels to Mr. William Freeland's--my new home. Mr. Freeland lived only three miles from St. Michaels, on an old, worn-out farm, which required much labor to render it anything like a self-supporting establishment.            I found Mr. Freeland a different man from Covey. Though not rich, he was what might have been called a well-bred Southern gentleman. Though a slaveholder and sharing in common with them many of the vices of      

    of the sixty slaves. We then proceeded on our way,  Boss by rail and we on foot, or in the wagon. We  went about twenty miles a day. I remember, as we  passed along, every white man we met was yelling,   Hurrah for Polk and Dallas!  They were feeling  good, for election had given them the men that they  wanted. The man who had us in charge joined with  those we met in the hurrahing. We were afraid to  ask them the reason for their yelling, as that would  have been regarded as an impertinence, and probably  would have caused us all to be whipped.            MY MISSISSIPPI HOME.            At length, after a long and wearisome journey, we  reached Pontotoc, McGee's home, on Christmas eve.  Boss took me into the house and into the sitting room,  where all the family were assembled, and presented  me as a Christmas gift to the madam, his wife.            My boss, as I remember him, was a tall, rawboned  man, but rather distinguished in looks, with a  fine carriage, brilliant in intellect, and considered  one of the wealthiest and most successful planters of  his time. Mrs. McGee was a handsome, stately lady,  about thirty years of age, brunette in complexion,  faultless in figure and imperious in manner. I think           that they were of Scotch descent. There were four  children, Emma, Willie, Johnnie and Jimmie. All   looked at me, and thought I was  a spry little fellow.   I was very shy and did not say much, as everything  was strange to me. I was put to sleep that night on  a pallet on the floor in the dining room, using an old  quilt as a covering. The next morning was Christmas,  and it seemed to be a custom to have egg-nog  before breakfast. The process of making this was  new and interesting to me. I saw them whip the  whites of eggs, on a platter, to a stiff froth; the yolks  were thoroughly beaten in a large bowl, sugar and  plenty of good brandy were added, and the whites of  the eggs and cream were then stirred in, a little nutmeg  grated on top of each glass when filled for serving.   This was a delicious drink, and the best of all  was, there was plenty of it. I served this to all the  family, and, as there were also visiting relatives  present, many glasses were required, and I found the  tray so heavy I could hardly carry it. I helped myself,  after the service was finished, and I was delighted,  for I had never tasted anything so fine before.            My boss told me I was to wait on the madam, do any  errand necessary, attend to the dining room  -  in             fact I was installed as general utility boy. It was  different from the quiet manner of life I had seen before  coming here  -  it kept my spirits up for some time.  I thought of my mother often, but I was gradually  growing to the idea that it was useless to cry, and I  tried hard to overcome my feelings.            PLANTATION LIFE.            As already stated, it was Christmas morning, and,  after breakfast, I saw the cook hurrying, and when I  went out into the yard, everywhere I looked slaves  met my view. I never saw so many slaves at one  time before. In Virginia we did not have such large  farms. There were no extensive cotton plantations,  as in Mississippi. I shall never forget the dinner  that day  -  it was a feast fit for a king, so varied and  lavish was the bill of fare. The next attraction for  me was the farm hands getting their Christmas rations.  Each was given a pint of flour of which they  made biscuit, which were called  Billy Seldom,   because biscuit were very rare with them. Their  daily food was corn bread, which they called  Johnny  Constant,  as they had it constantly. In addition to  the flour each received a piece of bacon or fat meat,  from which they got the shortening for their biscuit.           The cracklings from the rendering of lard were also  used by the slaves for shortening. The hands were  allowed four days off at Christmas, and if they worked  on these days, as some of them did, they got fifty  cents a day for chopping. It was not common to have  chopping done during the holidays; some planters,  however, found it convenient thus to get it out of the  way for the work which came after Christmas.    THE GREAT HOUSE.            I soon became familiar with my work in the house  and with the neighborhood, as I often had to carry  notes for Boss to neighboring farmers, as well as to  carry the mail to and from the postoffice. The  great  house,  as the dwelling of the master was called, was  two stories high, built of huge logs, chinked and  daubed and whitewashed. It was divided, from front  to rear, by a hall twenty-five feet long and twelve  feet wide, and on each side of the hall, in each story,  was one large room with a large fire-place. There  were but four rooms in all, yet these were so large  that they were equal to at least six of our modern  rooms. The kitchen was not attached to the main  building, but was about thirty feet to the rear. This  was the common mode of building in the south in       
     went to Heathsville, to the very place where I used to live, saw my master, who asked him whether, in his travels North, he had ever come across a man who was lame, shoemaker by trade; that he would give him two hundred dollars, cash, for any information which would lead to his discovery. He returned home, said nothing whatever to me, for fear I would be alarmed, sell out and leave the place; said nothing to any one about it till after January 1st, 1863, when freedom was proclaimed throughout the land.             During one of my visits to Heathsville, on which I always carried a large stock of clothing, shoes, etc., I formed a plan for some amusement among the young people. On Sunday it was announced that on a certain evening during the week there would be a Christmas tree. All were invited to come; accordingly when the time arrived, the church was packed; many came from miles away. I selected a young man who I intended should represent Father Christmas, as he is called there. I put on him a long swallow tail coat, the ends of which almost touched the floor, then he was filled out so as to be very large; he had on an extremely sharp pointed collar, which extended far out from his face, which was hidden behind a mask. I opened with an address, and at a given signal, Father Christmas made his first appearance. Many of the children, even some of the old people were frightened nearly out of their wits; one child ran forward, crying to his Uncle John to save him; some fell over each other to get out of the way. Well, I laughed till I could laugh no longer, and finally I was obliged to dispense with Father Christmas before anything like order           could be obtained. Then the different articles were distributed, and if you could have heard the many prayers that went up from thankful hearts for the gifts received, no one would tire of this good work. General satisfaction reigned, and after a hymn of thanksgiving they dispersed to their homes.             January, 1867, I was called to visit Washington, to see about a school for my daughter. While there I was invited by the pastor of Israel Church to preach on the Sabbath. At the close of the service many of my former friends came forward to greet me, and informed me of the old plantation where my brother and two sisters still resided. I immediately wrote to my brother to let him know that I was still alive, and that I should visit Heathsville at such a time, and asked him if  he thought there would be any danger in coming.  He informed me that  there was no danger, for Virginia was free.  When he received the letter it seemed as from one risen from the dead. My sister took the letter and went round amongst her friends, wild with joy.             A few weeks after this I made preparations to start on my long-premeditated journey, in the middle of June, 1867. I went by way of Washington. As I was proceeding down the old Potomac River her red banks looked natural to me, so much so that I could hardly suppress the feeling of joy which arose in my heart. That night the boat stopped about forty miles from Heathsville. The next morning, about light, I went ashore, as I was very anxious to tread once more on the old Virginia soil. Very soon the bell rang for the boat to start; I hastened on board again. By this time she      
   wash it.  She did not believe him, so she took a fork and stuck it in the pot, taking out the shirt, and she found the turkey. She asked him how the turkey got into the pot, he said he did not know but reckoned the turkey got in himself, as the fowls were very fond of going into the kitchen. So Joe was whipped because he allowed the turkey to get into the pot.      THE CUSTOM ON CHRISTMAS.           Both masters and slaves regarded Christmas as a great day. When the slaveholders made a large crop they were pleased, and gave the slaves from five to six days, which was much enjoyed by the negroes, especially by those who could dance. Christmas morning was held sacred both by master and slave, but in the afternoon or in a part of the next day the slaves were required to devote themselves to the pleasure of their masters. Some of the masters would buy presents for the slaves, such as hats and tobacco for the men, handkerchiefs and little things for the women, these things were given after they had been pleased with them, after either dancing or something for their amusement.           When the slaves came up to their master and mistress the latter would welcome them, the men would take off their hats and bow and the women would make a low courtesy. There would be two or three large pails filled with sweetened water with a gallon or two of whiskey in each, this was dealt out to them until they were partly drunk; while        this was going on those who could talk very well would give tokens of well wishing to their master and mistress, and some who were born in Africa would sing some of their songs, or tell different stories of the customs in Africa. After this they would spend half a day in dancing in some large cotton house or on a scaffold, the master providing fiddlers who came from other plantations if there were none on the place, and who received from fifteen to twenty dollars on these occasions.           A great many of the strict members of the church who did not dance would be forced to do it to please their masters, the favorite tunes were  The Fisher's Hornpipe,   The Devil's Dream,  and  Black-eyed Susan.  No one can describe the intense emotion  in the negro's soul on those occasions when they were trying to please their masters and mistresses.           After the dancing was over we had our presents, master giving to the men, and mistress to the women, then the slaves would go to their quarters and continue to dance the rest of the five or six days, and would sometimes dance until eight o'clock Sunday morning. The cabins were mostly made of logs and there were large cracks in them so that a person could see the light in them for miles in the night, and of course the sun's rays would shine through them in the daytime, so on Sunday morning when they were dancing and did not want to stop you would see them filling up the cracks with old rags. Their idea was, that it would not be Sunday        inside if they could keep the sun out, and thus they would not desecrate the sabbath; and these things continued until the freedom of the slaves.           Perhaps my readers would like to know if most of the negroes were inclined to violate the sabbath. they did, as the masters would make them do unnecessary work; they got into the habit of disregarding the day as one for rest and did many things Sunday which would not be allowed in the North. At that time if you should go through the South on those large cotton and rice plantations, while you would find some dancing on Sunday, others would be in the woods and fields hunting rabbits and other game, and some would be killing pigs belonging to their masters or neighbors. I remember when a small boy I went into the woods one Sunday morning with one of my fellow negroes whose name was Munson, but we called him Pash, and we killed one of master's pigs, hid it under the leaves until night, then took it home and dressed it. That was the only time I killed a pig, but I knew of thousands of cases like this in the time of slavery. But thank God the year of jubilee has come, and the negroes can return from dancing, from hunting, and from the masters' pig pens on Sundays and become observers of the sabbath, of good moral habits and men of equal rights before the law.        
   he told me no, and he would'nt do it, and found as much fault with Aaron as if I had been boarding with him six months. Aaron thinks instead of being an anti-slavery man that he is a great rebel as ever trod the soil of New England country. Aaron thinks if he had him in the South and he thought he could make one dollar on me that he would sell me as quick as lightning.           Aaron was a man born in the South. Aaron's parents have been dead this something like twenty-three years. Aaron says that it was nothing but hard work and hard usage that killed them. That gentleman in Millville, told me there was plenty of work to be done there. There were several told me there were two or three gentlemen in business there that were now broken up, and there were as many as eight or nine men there told me business was very hard. When a man's heart is shut up with sin and iniquity he generally always speaks what comes uppermost, let it be a lie or the truth, but the lie generally always comes first.     SLAVERY A SIN.           We believe slavery to be a sin--always, every where, and only sin. Sin in itself, apart from the occasional rigors incidental to its administration, and from all those perils, liabilities, and positive inflictions to which its victims are continually exposed. Sin is the nature of the act which created it, and in the elements which constitute it. Sin, because it converts persons into things; men into property; God's image into merchandize. Because it forbids men from using themselves for the advancement of their own well being, and turns them into mere instruments to be used by others solely for the benefit of the users. Because it constitutes one man the owner of the body, soul, and spirit of other men; gives him power and permission to make his own pecuniary profit, the great end of their being, thus striking them out of existence as beings, possessing rights and susceptibilities of happiness, and forcing them to exist merely as appendages to his own existence, in other words, because slavery holds and uses men as mere means for which to accomplish ends, of which end, their own interests are not a part. Thus annihilating the sacred and eternal distinction between a person and a thing; a distinction proclaimed an axiom of all human consciousness; a distinction created by God--crowned with glory and honor in the attributes, intelligence, morality, accountability and immortality, existence, and commended to the homage of universal mind, by the concurrent testimony of nature, providence, conscience and revelation, by the blood of the atonement, and the sanction of eternity, authenticated by the seal of Deity, and in its own nature, effaceless and immutable. This distinction slavery contemns, disannuls, and tramples under foot. This is its fundamental element--its vital constituent principle, that which makes it a sin in itself under whatever modification existing, all the incidental        effects of the system flow spontaneously from its fountain head. The constant exposure of the slaves to outrage and the actual inflictions which they experience in innumerable forms, all result legitimately from this principle, assumed in the theory and embodied in the practice of slave-holding.             Like Mary have you come early to the sepulchre seeking Jesus in the Tomb. Aaron thinks that hundreds and thousands of poor creatures, black and white, die in that manner every year, we never think to call upon our heavenly father, only when afflictions fall at our heels, then we'll call on our heavenly father. God commands us to shoulder our cross, to follow him through evil report as well as good. There is a great many lives humble and faithful to God, till sorrows and afflictions come against them, then they will flee like deadly poisoned, something like Judas and Peter, they will deny that they ever knew God. Let us all learn to be consistent, not to deceive our brethren, when we have the true love of God stamped in our unworthy hearts, then we'll shoulder our cross and follow Christ through evil report as well as good. Aaron has seen a good many men and women in his travels, the outward appearance appeared to Aaron to be Angels, when Aaron stopped with them a while, and come to have dealings with them, their hearts were as destitute of the love of God as a Pitcher,--complete wolves clothed in sheep's clothing.           Now reader, I want you to  remembeer  the Bible says he that is thought much of in the eyes of men is despised in my eyes, blessed is he who is despitefully used for my sake, the Bible says that he who calls his brother a fool is in danger of hell-fire. Aaron says that a true witness of Christ is persecuted on the right hand and on the left; are brought as sheep before the slaughter.           When Aaron was in Milford, two angels entertained him very hospitable, made him welcome to stay over the Sabbath with them; merely stopped awhile to ask their wives to write a little, and they insisted on my staying over the Sabbath day, and Aaron staid with them until Monday morning. I was in the house about fifteen hours, they began to find as much fault with me as if I had begged them to keep me a week. How wrong Aaron thinks it is when a man will stand up and tell his brother one thing, and have his heart another way, a hollow heart is tenfold worse than an Arab, an open enemy is less to be feared than a false friend. These two angels that entertained Aaron on the Sabbath day, were men who professed to be filled with gospel grace, but like Adna and Anthony filled with filthy lucre.       
     state of Ohio, and other free states, and even to Canada; besides this I was notorious for running away, from my boyhood.            I never told him that I had been a runaway longer than one month--neither did I tell him that I had not run away more than once in my life; for these questions he never asked me.            I afterwards found him to be one of the basest hypocrites that I ever saw. He looked like a saint--talked like the best of slave holding Christians, and acted at home like the devil.            When he saw my wife and child, he concluded to buy us. He paid for me twelve hundred dollars, and one thousand for my wife and child. He also bought several other slaves at the same time, and took home with him. His residence was in the parish of Claiborn, fifty miles up from the mouth of Red River.            When we arrived there, we found his slaves poor, ragged, stupid, and half-starved. The food he allowed them per week, was one peck of corn for each grown person, one pound of pork, and sometimes a molasses. This was all that they were allowed and if they got more they stole it.            He had one of the most cruel overseers to be found in that section of country. He weighed and measured out to them, their week's allowance of food very Sabbath morning. The overseer's horn was sounded two hours before daylight for them in the morning, in order that they should be ready for work before daylight. They were worked from daylight until after dark, without stopping but one half     
    recollect the sadness of her countenance, and the mournful sacredness of her words as they impressed themselves upon my youthful mind--never to be forgotten.            Mothers of the North! as you gaze upon the fair  forms of your idolised little ones, just pause for a  moment; how would you feel if you knew that at any  time the will of a tyrant--who neither could nor would  sympathise with your domestic feelings--might separate  them for ever from your embrace, not to be laid in the  silent grave  where the wicked cease from troubling  and where the weary are at rest,  but to live under the  dominion of tyrants and avaricious men, whose cold hearts cannot sympathise with your feelings, but who  will mock at any manifestation of tenderness, and  scourge them to satisfy the cruelty of their own  disposition; yet such is the condition of hundreds of  thousands of mothers in the southern states of America.            My mother used to instruct me in the principles of  morality, according to her own notion of what was good and pure; but I had no means of acquiring proper conception of  religion in a state of slavery, where all those who professed  to be followers of Jesus Christ evinced more of the  disposition of demons than of men; and it is really a matter  of wonder to me now, considering the character of my position that I did not imbibe a strong and lasting hatred  of everything pertaining to the religion of Christ. My lessons in morality were of the most simple kind. I was told not to steal, not to tell lies, and to behave myself  in a becoming manner towards everybody. My      
  as prayer was over, I was taken and severely chastised.          My master's family consisted of himself, his wife, and their nephew, William Moore. He was taken into the family when only a few weeks of age. His name being that of my own, mine was changed for the purpose of giving precedence to his, though I was his senior by ten or twelve years. The plantation being four miles from the city, I had to drive the family to church. I always dreaded the approach of the Sabbath; for, during service, I was obliged to stand by the horses in the hot, broiling sun, or in the rain, just as it happened.          One Sabbath, as we were driving past the house of D. D. Page, a gentleman who owned a large baking establishment, as I was sitting upon the box of the carriage, which was very much elevated, I saw Mr.   same gentleman, but a short time previous, tied up a woman of his, by the name of Delphia, and whipped her nearly to death; yet he was a deacon in the Baptist church, in good and regular standing.  Poor Delphia! I was well acquainted with her, and called to see her while upon her sick bed; and I shall never forget her appearance. She was a member of the same church with her master.          Soon after this, I was hired out to Mr. Walker, the same man whom I have mentioned as having carried a gang of slaves down the river on the steamboat Enterprise. Seeing me in the capacity of a steward on the boat, and thinking that I would make a good hand to take care of slaves, he determined  to have me for that purpose; and finding that my master would not sell me, he hired me for the term of one year.          When I learned the fact of my having been hired to a negro speculator, or a  soul driver,  as they are generally called among slaves, no one can tell my emotions. Mr. Walker had offered a high price for me, as I afterwards learned, but I suppose my master was restrained from selling me by the fact that I was a near relative of his. On entering the service of Mr. Walker, I found that my opportunity      
             Nature never intended that men and women should be either slaves or slaveholders, and nothing but rigid training long persisted in, can perfect the character of the one or the other.            Mrs. Auld was singularly deficient in the qualities of a slaveholder. It was no easy matter for her to think or to feel that the curly-headed boy, who stood by her side, and even leaned on her lap, who was loved by little Tommy, and who loved little Tommy in turn, sustained to her only the relation of a chattel. I was more than that; she felt me to be more than that. I could talk and sing; I could laugh and weep; I could reason and remember; I could love and hate. I was human, and she, dear lady, knew and felt me to be so. How could she then treat me as a brute, without a mighty struggle with all the noblest powers of her soul? That struggle came, and the will and power of the husband were victorious. Her noble soul was overcome, and he who wrought the wrong was injured in the fall no less than the rest of the household. When I went into that household, it was the abode of happiness and contentment. The wife and mistress there was a model of affection and tenderness. Her fervent piety and watchful uprightness made it impossible to see her without thinking and feeling that  that woman is a Christian.  There was no sorrow nor suffering for which she had not a tear, and there was no innocent joy for which she had not a smile. She had bread for the hungry, clothes for the naked, and comfort for every mourner who came within her reach.            But slavery soon proved its ability to divest her of these excellent qualities, and her home of its early happiness. Conscience cannot stand much violence. Once thoroughly injured, who is he who can repair the damage? If it be broken toward the slave on Sunday, it will be toward the master on Monday. It cannot long endure          such shocks. It must stand unharmed, or it does not stand at all. As my condition in the family waxed bad, that of the family waxed no better. The first step in the wrong direction was the violence done to nature and to conscience in arresting the benevolence that would have enlightened my young mind. In ceasing to instruct me, my mistress had to seek to justify herself  to  herself, and once consenting to take sides in such a debate, she was compelled to hold her position. One needs little knowledge of moral philosophy to see where she inevitably landed. She finally became even more violent in her opposition to my learning to read than was Mr. Auld himself. Nothing now appeared to make her more angry than seeing me, seated in some nook or corner, quietly reading a book or newspaper. She would rush at me with the utmost fury, and snatch the book or paper from my hand, with something of the wrath and consternation which a traitor might be supposed to feel on being discovered in a plot by some dangerous spy. The conviction once thoroughly established in her mind, that education and slavery were incompatible with each other, I was most narrowly watched in all my movements. If I remained in a separate room from the family for any considerable length of time, I was sure to be suspected of having a book, and was at once called to give an account of myself. But this was too late: the first and never-to-be-retraced step had been taken. Teaching me the alphabet had been the  inch  given, I was now waiting only for the opportunity to  take the ell.             Filled with the determination to learn to read at any cost, I hit upon many expedients to accomplish that much desired end. The plan which I mainly adopted, and the one which was the most successful, was that of using as teachers my young white playmates, with whom I met on the streets. I used almost constantly to carry a copy of          Webster's spelling-book in my pocket, and when sent of errands, or when play-time was allowed me, I would step aside with my young friends and take a lesson in spelling. I am greatly indebted to these boys--Gustavus Dorgan, Joseph Bailey, Charles Farity, and William Cosdry.            Although slavery was a delicate subject and, in Maryland, very cautiously talked about among grown up people, I frequently talked with the white boys about it, and that very freely. I would sometimes say to them, while seated on a curbstone or a cellar door,  I wish I could be free, as you will be when you get to be men.   You will be free, you know, as soon as you are twenty-one, and can go where you like, but I am a slave for life. Have I not as good a right to be free as you have?  Words like these, I observed, always troubled them; and I had no small satisfaction in drawing out from them, as I occasionally did, that fresh and bitter condemnation of slavery which ever springs from natures unseared and unperverted. Of all consciences, let me have those to deal with, which have not been seared and bewildered with the cares and perplexities of life. I do not remember ever while I was in slavery, to have met with a  boy  who defended the system, but I do remember many times, when I was consoled by them, and by them encouraged to hope that something would yet occur by which I would be made free. Over and over again, they have told me that  they believed I had as good a right to be free as  they  had,  and that  they did not believe God ever made any one to be a slave.  It is easily seen that such little conversations with my playfellows had no tendency to weaken my love of liberty, nor to render me contented as a slave.            When I was about thirteen years old, and had succeeded in learning to read, every increase of knowledge, especially anything respecting the free states, was an          additional weight to the almost intolerable burden of my thought--  I am a slave for life.   To my bondage I could see no end. It was a terrible reality, and I shall never be able to tell how sadly that thought chafed my young spirit. Fortunately or unfortunately, I had, by blacking boots for some gentlemen, earned a little money with which I purchased of Mr. Knight, on Thames street, what was then a very popular school book, viz.,  The Columbian Orator,  for which I paid fifty cents. I was led to buy this book by hearing some little boys say that  they were going to learn some pieces out of it for the exhibition. This volume was indeed a rich treasure, and, for a time, every opportunity afforded me was spent in diligently perusing it. Among much other interesting matter, that which I read again and again with unflagging satisfaction was a short dialogue between a master and his slave. The slave is represented as having been recaptured in a second attempt to run away; and the master opens the dialogue with an upbraiding speech, charging the slave with ingratitude, and demanding to know what he has to say in his own defense. Thus upbraided and thus called upon to reply, the slave rejoins that he knows how little anything that he can say will avail, seeing that he is completely in the hands of his owner; and with noble resolution, calmly says,  I submit to my fate.  Touched by the slave's answer, the master insists upon his further speaking, and recapitulates the many acts of kindness which he has performed toward the slave, and tells him he is permitted to speak for himself. Thus invited, the quondam slave made a spirited defense of himself, and thereafter the whole argument for and against slavery is brought out. The master was vanquished at every turn in the argument, and, appreciating the fact, he generously and meekly emancipates the slave, with his best wishes for his prosperity.                   It is unnecessary to say that a dialogue with such an origin and such an end, read by me when every nerve of my being was in revolt at my own condition as a slave, affected me most powerfully. I could not help feeling that the day might yet come when the well-directed answers made by the slave to the master, in this instance, would find a counterpart in my own experience. This, however, was not all the fanaticism which I found in the Columbian Orator. I met there one of Sheridan's mighty speeches on the subject of Catholic Emancipation, Lord Chatham's speech on the American War, and speeches by the great William Pitt, and by Fox. These were all choice documents to me, and I read them over and over again, with an interest ever increasing, because it was ever gaining in intelligence; for the more I read them the better I understood them. The reading of these speeches added much to my limited stock of language, and enabled me to give tongue to many interesting thoughts which had often flashed through my mind and died away for want of words in which to give them utterance. The mighty power and heart-searching directness of truth penetrating the heart of a slave-holder and compelling him to yield up his earthly interests to the claims of eternal justice, were finely illustrated in the dialogue, and from the speeches of Sheridan I got a bold and powerful denunciation of oppression and a most brilliant vindication of the rights of man.            Here was indeed a noble acquisition. If I had ever wavered under the consideration that the Almighty, in some way, had ordained slavery and willed my enslavement for His own glory, I wavered no longer. I had now penetrated to the secret of all slavery and of all oppression, and had ascertained their true foundation to be in the pride, the power and the avarice of man. With a book in my hand so redolent of the principles of liberty, and          with a perception of my own human nature and of the facts of my past and present experience, I was equal to a contest with the religious advocates of slavery, whether white or black; for blindness in this matter was not confined to the white people. I have met, at the south, many good, religious colored people who were under the delusion that God required them to submit to slavery and to wear their chains with meekness and humility. I could entertain no such nonsense as this, and I quite lost my patience when I found a colored man weak enough to believe such stuff. Nevertheless, eager as I was to partake of the tree of knowledge, its fruits were bitter as well as sweet.  Slaveholders,  thought I,  are only a band of successful robbers, who, leaving their own homes, went into Africa for the purpose of stealing and reducing my people to slavery.  I loathed them as the meanest and the most wicked of men. And as I read, behold! the very discontent so graphically predicted by Master Hugh had already come upon me. I was no longer the light-hearted, gleesome boy full of mirth and play, that I was when I landed in Baltimore. Light had penetrated the moral dungeon where I had lain, and I saw the bloody whip for my back and the iron chain for my feet, and my  good, kind  master was the author of my situation. The revelation haunted me, stung me, and made me gloomy and miserable. As I writhed under the sting and torment of this knowledge I almost envied my fellow slaves their stupid indifference. It opened my eyes to the horrible pit, and revealed the teeth of the frightful dragon that was ready to pounce upon me; but alas, it opened no way for my escape. I wished myself a beast, a bird, anything rather than a slave. I was wretched and gloomy beyond my ability to describe. This everlasting thinking distressed and tormented me; and yet there was no getting rid of this subject of my thoughts. Liberty, as the inestimable         birthright of every man, converted every object into an asserter of this right. I heard it in every sound, and saw it in every object. It was ever present to torment me with a sense of my wretchedness. The more beautiful and charming were the smiles of nature, the more horrible and desolate was my condition. I saw nothing without seeing it, and I heard nothing without hearing it. I do not exaggerate when I say that it looked at me in every star, smiled in every calm, breathed in every wind and moved in every storm. I have no doubt that my state of mind had something to do with the change in treatment which my mistress adopted towards me. I can easily believe that my leaden, downcast, and disconsolate look was very offensive to her. Poor lady! She did not understand my trouble, and I could not tell her. Could I have made her acquainted with the real state of my mind and given her the reasons therefor, it might have been well for both of us. As it was, her abuse fell upon me like the blows of the false prophet upon his ass; she did not know that an angel stood in the way. Nature made us friends, but slavery had made us enemies. My interests were in a direction opposite to hers, and we both had our private thoughts and plans. She aimed to keep me ignorant, and I resolved to  know,  although knowledge only increased my misery. My feelings were not the result of any marked cruelty in the treatment I received; they sprung from the consideration of my being a slave at all. It was  slavery,  not its mere  incidents  that I hated. I had been cheated. I saw through the attempt to keep me in ignorance. I saw that slaveholders would have gladly made me believe that, in making a slave of me and in making slaves of others, they were merely acting under the authority of God, and I felt to them as to robbers and deceivers. The feeding and clothing me well could not atone for taking my liberty from me. The     
    it. I could hardly move after the terrible ordeal was  finished, and could scarcely bear my clothes to touch  me at first, so sore was my whole body, and it was  weeks before I was myself again.    PREACHING TO THE SLAVES.             As an offset, probably, to such diabolical cruelties  as those which were practiced upon me in common  with nearly all the slaves in the cotton region of the  south, it was the custom in the section of country  where I lived to have the white minister preach to the  servants Sunday afternoon, after the morning service  for the whites. The white people hired the minister  by the year to preach for them at their church. Then  he had to preach to each master's slaves in turn. The  circuit was made once a month, but there was service  of some kind every Sunday. The slaves on some  places gathered in the yard, at others in the white  folks' school houses, and they all seemed pleased and  eager to hear the word of God. It was a strong evidence  of their native intelligence and discrimination  that they could discern the difference between the  truths of the  word  and the professed practice of  those truths by their masters. My Boss took pride in  having all his slaves look clean any tidy at the Sabbath         service; but how would he have liked to have the  slaves, with backs lacerated with the lash, appear in  those assemblies with their wounds uncovered?  The  question can never be answered. The master and  most of his victims have gone where professions of  righteousness will not avail to cover the barbarities  practiced here.    A FAMILY OF FREE PERSONS SOLD INTO SLAVERY.             My wife Matilda was born in Fayette county,  Kentucky, June 17th, 1830. It seems that her mother  and her seven children were to have been free according  to the old Pennsylvania law. There were two  uncles of the family who were also to have been free,  but who had been kept over time; so they sued for  their freedom, and gained it. The lawyers in the  case were abolitionists and friends to the slaves, and saw that these men had justice. After they had  secured their freedom, they entered suit for my wife's  mother, their sister, and her seven children. But as  soon as the brothers entered this suit, Robert Logan,  who claimed my wife's mother and her children as his  slaves, put them into a trader's yard in Lexington;  and, when he saw that there was a possibility of their  being successful in securing their freedom, he put      
   his cotton, as he got other master's niggers to steal for  him to make him rich.  Mr. Neddy Anderson, and William  Miles, and Stevondecause, are very bad men more like  beasts than men they used to go about all the plantations  on Sunday nights, and frighten the negroes that used to  come together to hold prayer-meetings, chasing them here  and there, and whipping as many as they could catch  without a pass.  Mr. Anderson spends a great deal  of his time in plaiting whips to whip the negroes with;  my mistress hired him as overseer to come and flog all the  negroes, and me in particular, after Christmas, because I  had a black pony.  But she gave us three days at Christmas,  and I have not been home since; for I and the pony  gave them leg-bail for security, and thank God, got safe  to a Free State.          Two negroes were being taken away from their families  in chains to the new countries, on the way there, the master  stopped for dinner at one of the planter's houses,  while the slaves were fastened to a tree.  After dinner, he  sent for his horse to be brought.  The horse would not let  the slave put the bridle on him, he bit at him.   Master,   said the slave,  I can't catch your horse, he bites.    Oh,  well, I'll go.   he went, and said,  What are you about, sir?  and rubbing him down behind, and lifting one of his  hind feet, the horse kicked his brains out.  The slaves were  then let loose and sent back.          The Rev. Mr. Reed, minister of Mount Zion Church,  South Carolina, when his wife wanted him to whip her slave  girl, he said,  I can't, I am a minister of the gospel.     Well, other ministers whip their niggers, and you can  whip yours, too.    No, I can't.    Well, I will send  her to Mr. Sam. Wilson, and have her whipped.   So she  sat down and wrote a few lines, and she called her slave  girl to her and said,  Here, Madam Manda, take this letter  to Mr. Wilson.   Which was five miles from her  house.  When he broke open the letter, he read,  Please  give the bearer fifty lashes on the bare back, well put on.    The girl looked astonished, and thought she had committed  some crime, and said,  Please massa, don't whip  me, mistress gave me this letter to give you.   He said,  I  don't care, I am going to give you fifty lashes.   After she  was flogged, she returned to her cruel mistress, who examined  her back, and said,  Right good for you; I'm  glad, I long wanted you whipped.   A drunken slave-     
     place of both housekeeper and waiting maid to her mistress. She was, in fact, at the beginning and end of every thing.           Mrs. Flint, like many southern women, was totally deficient in energy. She had not strength to superintend her household affairs; but her nerves were so strong, that she could sit in her easy chair and see a woman whipped, till the blood trickled from every stroke of the lash. She was a member of the church; but partaking of the Lord's supper did not seem to put her in a Christian frame of mind. If dinner was not served at the exact time on that particular Sunday, she would station herself in the kitchen, and wait till it was dished, and then spit in all the kettles and pans that had been used for cooking. She did this to prevent the cook and her children from eking out their meagre fare with the remains of the gravy and other scrapings. The slaves could get nothing to eat except what she chose to give them. Provisions were weighed out by the pound and ounce, three times a day. I can assure you she gave them no chance to eat wheat bread from her flour barrel. She knew how many biscuits a quart of flour would make, and exactly what size they ought to be.           Dr. Flint was an epicure. The cook never sent a dinner to his table without fear and trembling; for if there happened to be a dish not to his liking, he would either order her to be whipped, or compel her to eat every mouthful of it in his presence. The poor, hungry creature might not have objected to eating it; but she did object to having her master cram it down her throat till she choked.           They had a pet dog, that was a nuisance in the house.      
     and subjected to a mock trial, with the object of scaring me into flight from the place. At Palmyra I found no  hall or church in which I could speak. Indeed, the place was then a mere hamlet and could boast of but half a dozen  dwellings. My tour embraced nearly every village in this and adjoining counties, and the treatment given me varied with the kind of people I happened to find in the budding settlements of the time. In the same fall I attended the first  Anti-Slavery State Convention at Utica.            In 1835 I left Rochester to form a colored church at Syracuse. Of course I joined anti-slavery work to the labor which fell upon me as a pastor. In the city last named the opponents  of the movement laid a trap for me, by proposing a public discussion of the leading questions at issue. I was a little  afraid of my ability to cope with them alone, and, therefore, quietly wrote to Gerrett Smith, Beriah Green and Alvin  Steward for help. When the public discussion took place, and these practiced speakers met answered the arguments of our  opponents, the representatives of the latter--the leading editor and the foremost lawyer of the place--left the church in disgust, pleading that they had a good case, but did not expect to face men so well able to handle any question as the friends of mine I had invited. After their retreat from the hall, the two champions of slavery stirred up the salt boilers to mob us, but we adjourned before night, and when the crowd arrived at the edifice they found only a prayer meeting of the church people in progress, and slunk away ashamed. I was stationed nearly three years at Syracuse, and was then transferred to Ithaca, where a little colored religious society already existed. I bought a site for a church edifice for them, and saw it built during the two years of my stay in the village. Thence I was sent to Sag Harbor, Long Island, and, finally, to New Bedford, Massachusetts.            It was at New Bedford that I first saw Fred. Douglass. He was then, so to speak, right out of slavery, but had already begun to talk in public, though not before white people. He had been  given authority to act as an exhorter by the church before my coming, and I some time afterwards licensed him to preach. He was then a member of my church. On one occasion, after I had addressed a white audience on the slavery question, I called upon Fred. Douglass, whom I saw among the auditors, to relate his story.  He did so, and in a year from that time he was in the lecture field with Parker Pillsbury and other leading abolitionist orators. Not long afterwards a letter was received from him by his fellow church members, in which he said that he had cut loose from the church; he had found that the American church was the bulwark of American slavery.           We did not take the letter to mean that Mr. Douglass had repudiated the Christian religion at the same time that he  bade good-by to the churches.            It was soon after this that great excitement arose in New Bedford over the action of Rev. Mr. Jackson, a Baptist minister,  who had just returned from a Baltimore clerical convention, which sent a petition to the Maryland Legislature in favor  of the passage of a law compelling free negroes to leave the state, under the plea that the free colored men mingling  with the slaves incited the latter to insurrection. Rev. Mr. Jackson was a vice-president of that convention and a party to its action. Printed accounts of the proceedings were sent to me, and at a meeting called to express dissent from the course taken by the minister named and his brethren, I introduced a resolution, of which the following is a copy:              Resolved,  That the great body of the American clergy, with all their pretensions to  sanctity, stand convicted by their deadly hostility to the Anti-Slavery movement, and their support of the slave system,  as a brotherhood of thieves, and should be branded as such by all honest Christians.             The tone and tenor of this resolution now carry an air of extravagant injustice, but there was at that time only too much  truth in the charge it contains. The resolution was tabled, but it was at the same time decided to publish it, and to  invite the ministers of the town to appear at an adjourned meeting and defend their course, if they could. Nearly thirty ministers of New Bedford and vicinity appeared at the next meeting, and with one voice denounced the obnoxious resolution and its author. The result was that a strong prejudice was excited against me, a prejudice that was increased by an event which took place soon afterwards--the whole due to the fact that the respectable and wealthy classes, as well as the lower orders, at that time regarded abolitionists with equal aversion and contempt. The conscience of the North had not yet been fairly awakened to the monstrous wrong of human bondage.            On my journey homeward from a visit to New York city, I met Mr. Henry Ludlam, his wife, two children, and a slave girl, from Richmond, Va., all bound for New Bedford to spend the summer  with Captain Dunbar, father-in-law of the head of this party of visitors. I said that I met them, but the meeting  consisted only in this, that they and I were on board the same train, but not in the same car. I was in the  Jim  Crow  car, as colored persons were not permitted to enter the others with white people, and the slave girl was sent to the same car by the same rule. I talked with her, and, as I was in duty bound to do, asked her to come to my church during the stay of the family in New Bedford. After some      
            I was taken to the nearest depot and thence to my Master, who paid fifty dollars for my recovery. I was taken to the garret in his home, handcuffed for the night, and, to make sure I would not escape again, Peter was handcuffed to me. The next morning Peter was released,  skackles  were placed on my legs, and I remained in this shape till about 10 o'clock, when Master and his brother William, who was his slave agent, came to the garret, took off the  skackles,  handcuffed my hands behind my back and took me to the punishment room or shanty where I saw Bob lying on a few boards, his throat cut and he was slowly dying in great misery. From him I afterwards learned that about half an hour after I left the field, Master and three slave drivers came to the still house, sent for Bob to come there, which he did, not mistrusting what was before him. As soon as he arrived the four men all pounced upon him like four ravenous wolves upon a lamb. He fought all of them till he was overpowered. They then drove four stakes in the ground and he was tied to these with his back up and the four men took turns lashing him with a raw hide whip, the black snake I have referred to, until his back appeared like a piece of beefsteak pounded. They then took hot coals from the furnace and poured them over his back, after which they took him to the punishment  cabin, shackled his feet, chained him to the punishment block and in the night two of them went into the cabin and cut his throat, taking care not to cut the jugular, but cutting just enough so he would die gradually in torture.           Bob's condition was a lesson to the rest of us, and no means were allowed to escape making it an impressive one. He lived in this condition for five days and then his poor soul took its flight to the region where it        is hoped no slave holder will ever have the privilege of exercising his power over human beings.           Talk to me about human slavery being a  Divine institution!  As well tell me the devil is a merciful God. The system not only degraded the slave, but it degraded the master even more. Any man of the South who is a descendant of a slave holder who upheld the system of American slavery, ought to blush with shame for his degraded origin. I have in me the blood of one such, on the side of my father, and to me, my poor black negro mother shines as an angel in comparison to a devil, and, if I could, I would willingly draw from my veins every drop of that white blood that goes pulsing through my body received by way of my father. It is the only stain I have, received from the laws of nature, of which I am ashamed, while on the other hand, I am proud of my negro blood. Poor Bob's skin was black, but his soul was pure and in the great future where, we are taught, we shall be ruled by a just God, what will be Bob's condition in comparison with those who tormented and murdered him? But, the worst of all is, that Rosa, whom Bob loved and trusted, was his betrayer. The white blood in her tainted her so that she was equally as bad as her ancestors. Perhaps, however, there was some excuse for her. She was bright and intelligent beyond most of her people, or even many of the whites, and it may be that she had learned to love her Master and was blinded, by reason of this, to all humanity for another. Had she carried out all that she promised to Bob and started to leave with him and been captured, she would have shared his fate. Perhaps she was not strong enough to fully recognize the enormity of her relations with her Master and maybe she hoped those relations would some day be the means of her own freedom.        As bad as it is we do not wholly condemn when men are cast upon the ocean where sure death is before them unless they have food and then draw cuts to see which one shall die to furnish food for the others. Perhaps she regarded her own condition much like the above and acted as she did to save herself. I do not know. I would like to shield her if I could, but I sometimes fear she was the treacherous being Bob believed and she appeared to be.           Bob was at last dead and then followed his funeral. A box was made into which he was placed, all the slaves were brought to view his remains, a grave was dug, the improvised coffin was loaded into a cart and we all followed him to his burial. After the remains were lowered into the grave Master preached what was called a funeral sermon. The substance of his words were:  This negro, Bob, was a bad man. I paid my money for him and I was his master. You all know that if he had done right as you have done, he would never have been where he is. He cut his own throat and beat me out of my money. You know that I must be obeyed and if you do not obey me I must whip you; but he was so mean that whipping was of no use to him and it would have been better for you and me if his throat had been cut long ago. There isn't one among you but knows I have done right, as he was a mean, mean negro. You must understand there is no Lord or God who has anything to do with any of you, as I alone am your Master, your maker and your law giver, and when you do what I tell you to do you will get along all right.            After Bob's condition had been impressed upon me sufficiently, as they thought, and before Bob had died, at the time they took me to see him, I was again taken to the garret, from there I was taken to a ladder which     
    darkest season of despairing agony that I had yet  known. This came upon me in consequence of the visit,  which I have already described, to my dear old desolate  home. About this time, too, I entered on a new  and distinct period of life, which I will unfold in another  chapter. I will close this period of sorrow and  shame with a few lines of touching interest to my mind.    Who shall avenge the slave? I stood and cried;  The earth, the earth, the echoing sea replied.  I turned me to the ocean, but each wave  Declined to be the avenger of the slave.  Who  shall  avenge the slave? my species cried;  The winds, the flood, the lightnings of the sky.  I turned to these, from them one echo ran,  The  right  avenger of the slave is man.  Man was my fellow; in  his  sight I stood,   Wept and besought him by the voice of blood.  Sternly he looked, as proud on earth he trod,  Then said, the avenger of the slave is  GOD.   I looked in prayer towards Heaven, a while 'twas still,  And then methought, God's voice replied, I  WILL.      CHAPTER  SECOND.            I enter  now upon a new development of wrongs and  woes which I, as a slave, was called to undergo. I  must go back some two or three years from the time  when my master died, and I was sold to Owen Holmes.The bitterness of persecution which master Jones had  kept up against me so long, because I would try to  serve the Lord, had passed away. I was permitted to  pray and go to our meetings without molestation. My  master laid aside his terrible severity towards me. By  his treatment to me afterwards, he  seemed  to feel that  he had done wrong in scourging me as he had done,  because I could not obey his wicked command, to stop  praying, and keep away from the meetings. For, after  the time of my joining the Church, he allowed me to  go to all the meetings, and granted me many other little  favors, which I had never before received from him.  About this time I began to feel very lonely. I wanted       
     month we do at home what we would denounce if done abroad. How inconsistent!             It is but justice to add that, notwithstanding our delinquencies as a church, we are doing more for the religious instruction of the colored people than any other denomination in the Southern States. While we rejoice that the Baptists of Georgia recognize, in their religious ordinances, the common humanity of the negro, it is painful to think that the laws of Georgia permit a lady who is received into the church at the same time with her servant, and who acknowledges that servant as a Christian sister, to send the latter the next day to the slave mart to be sold, far from husband and children, to be separated from the care of her pastor, and to be deprived of religious ordinances. And what is more painful, if true, is that the minister who baptized her upholds and justifies the law of the State of Georgia,  which gives the mistress such unlimited power over her colored sister in Christ.       THE SIN OF SLAVERY.             In estimating the evils of slavery on masters           and owners, we must not overtook the  guilt  contracted, and the  remorse  endured by those who hold, breed, and sell slaves for the market. And none but the All-seeing Eye knows the full cup of misery which they drink. True, no outward voice condemns them. The politician and the preacher may tell the slave-breeder that his business is  all right; that the Lord sent the African here to be Christianized, to prepare him to go to Liberia to convert the heathen.  But conscience whispers:  It is sin!  Thoughts of death and judgment flash terror to his heart, even in the moment of greatest revelry. He feels like the duelist feels, when he thinks of the death, by separation, he has occasioned. Thou blood-stained soul, thou wilt bear me witness that I never soothed thy guilty conscience by telling thee that slavery was not forbidden in the New Testament!             I have often observed, in men who have sold slaves, a peculiar restlessness about the eye; and with such men, the least reference to slavery is as fire in the bosom. How hard it is for State laws and worldly sophistry to efface the eternal impress of right and wrong! The duelist          may take the life of his brother, and receive the plaudits of the community, yet his inward monitor will not be quiet, but ceaselessly whispers,  Thou art a murderer!  And thus it is with the slaveholder. He robs the slave of his intellect and affections, and the laws of the land say he does right. But the inward voice whispers,  Thy sin will find thee out!       THE FREE NEGROES OF MARYLAND.             Maryland contains more free colored persons than any other State in the Union. They number 74,000. The question has been asked:  How has it come to pass that this State contains so many free colored persons?  I believe that the result is principally due to the rapid spread of Methodism in its borders from 1776 to 1810. The early Methodists denounced the holding of slaves as a sin in private members as well as in ministers. In those days, slaves prayed ardently for the conversion of their masters, knowing that the law of love worked good to the master and emancipation to the slave.      
    thought I was safe, I stopped. I was ignorant of what I had  so seriously done to cause all this. I remained here all that  night.            At last Sunday morning dawned and found me hiding  from the fierce anger of a man who would soon be making  his way to church; but I could not go. I had no one to  speak to but God. Alone, yet not alone. My thoughts  may he somewhat surmised when I inform my readers of the  sacred relationship of the man who had just attempted to  take my life. He was a local preacher in the Methodist  Church, and considered one of its most pious and consistent  members. His religious fervor was so great that he could  not content himself with his own church, but also identified  his name with the colored Methodist Church of which I was  a member. He would frequently attend our meetings, jump,  shout and sing, like the rest of us. He was the leader of  my class, my spiritual adviser and counsellor in the time of  trouble. Now, by his merciless treatment, I am driven from  the shelter of his home. What could I think of him? How  could I judge of his religious profession? How could I  receive his religious instructions? The more I thought of  him this day the more my confidence in him grew weaker.  He was my master, and by the inhuman law of slavery I  was his property and must obey his mandates. During the  day my hiding-place was discovered by a fellow-slave who  brought me food, which removed a portion of sorrow from  my wounded breast. In this affliction I found, as in former  instances, that by turning my heart towards God, He would  take care of me and provide for my wants. The Sabbath  day drearily passed away, and night found me still among  the mulberry bushes to spend a second night without  shelter, bed or covering.                  On Monday morning my  pious master  told one of the  slave hands if he saw me to tell me to  come home!   When I received the message I immediately returned. On  my arrival I met the would-be murderer, and he wanted to  know  why I acted so; why I threw the meat to the dog?   In an instant the cause of Saturday's conflict and Sunday's  sorrow came to my mind. Refusing to eat rotten beef and  casting it to the dog had brought down his vengeance on my  much-defenceless head. The secret was revealed. Miss  Wallace had witnessed the act, taking it as a great insult  to herself. To use his own expression:  It was an insult  to Miss Wallace, for she had sent it out to the kitchen.  I  replied that I did not know it was an insult, I did not mean  to insult her, and she did not know how bad it smelled. He  abruptly told me to go to work and he would see about it.  So we parted; he to counsel other methods of punishment or  revenge, and I to my work on the farm. At this season we  were busily engaged hauling lime to the farm. We completed  this job in three weeks, then we had to gather in the  corn and tread out some wheat. The treading was done by  horses in what was called the  treading yard.  It was  about the middle of November when this portion of our  annual work was completed.           The first important job that was assigned to Will (for  my master always called me by that name), after finishing  the farm work, was to take the horse and cart, with a note,  and go to Mr. H. Wallace's for a barrel of turkeys and  geese that were to be sent to Baltimore, Md. During all this  time I had not heard anything about the spoiled meat  trouble. I concluded it had all passed by, and to me almost  forgotten. My conception of the trickery of mankind were        very small at that time. If I had known the contents of the  note, and what kind of poultry I was sent after, I would no  doubt have been tempted to have resorted to my mulberry  home, or some other more distant, but I did not. I had  more lessons to learn. At two o'clock I started on my  errand. The distance by the public road was ten miles,  and it would be some time before I could return. I was  acquainted with a road that would take me directly there,  by crossing lands belonging to other persons, and the  distance would not be more than three miles; so in order to  economize time for the boss I took that route. This way I  knew would bring me in contact with a creek a little below  Mr. W's house. He always kept a boat on this creek, so  that persons coming to or going from his house by that way  could be ferried across by one of the slaves. The horse and  cart were secured; I gave the signal and was soon safely  landed on the other side. I inquired for the master of the  mansion, and was directed to the treading yard. I soon  found him, and delivered to him in person my trust and the  message for the featherless and lifeless birds that were never  to be seen. He gave me a pitchfork, telling me to shake up  that straw, he would give me what I wanted pretty soon.  I always endeavored to obey orders, so I complied by going  to work with a good will pitching straw. I worked on,  expecting every moment to receive the answer to my errand,  but still it did not come. As it began to grow dark I became  apprehensive that something was wrong. Finally, I told  Mr. Wallace that I must be going home as I had work to  do; would he please give me the turkeys and geese? He,  to my great astonishment, struck me with his pitchfork with  so much force that he broke it over my shoulders.                   At this sudden change of affairs I suddenly started on  the run, with he and his son after me like hounds in full  chase after the fleeing fox. My safety depended upon my  agile movements. My active feet did me good service and  soon left my pursuers far behind. My impulsive thought  was to flee directly home and secure the protection of him  whom I was compelled to call master. Alas! alas! I was  placing my trust in one who was betraying me, who was  deceiving me; and soon I was to discover the blackness of  his heart toward me. The vigorous efforts of the maddened  foe pressed on me so great that the road for home had to be  abandoned, and I had to flee to the dense woods for refuge.  They were safely reached, and I could once more breathe  easily. Here I remained till after midnight, when I thought  I could venture out and try to find my way home. The  great wonder was, how could I succeed. I knew Mr. W.  always kept his boats in such a manner that I could get one  and row across the creek; but then came the dread that they  might be watching that means of escape and would capture  me. That route had to be abandoned and another found.  Blinded with grief and darkness I started up the creek in  search of some shallow place where I might walk across.  On I walked till at last I halted at a spot that I thought  would do. The stream here was narrow; in I ventured.  Step after step brought me into deeper water. Suddenly I  found that I was beyond my depth. I could not swim, I  could not go back. The scenes of death were before me.  There was no one near by to call upon to save me. In the  midst of my dilemma I remembered the Lord; upon Him  with my whole heart I did call. If ever I prayed in my life  I did this time. Soon my eyes became dim, my mind        bewildered, and consciousness had departed from me. How  long I remained in the water after that I know not. When  consciousness returned I found myself safely resting on the  opposite shore wet and cold. My escape was miraculous,  and I attributed it all to God.           Once more on terra firma I started for home, arriving  there about four o'clock in the morning. I found that the  horse and cart had arrived home during the night, having  been brought there by one of Mr. Wallace's men. Next  morning my boss met me when I was coming from the barn.  He informed me that  Mr. W. was going to whip me for  being impudent to his daughter in throwing that meat to  the dog, and I had better have stayed and got it and had it  over.  I told him that I belonged to him, and if he wanted  to do it I would submit  -  I did not want anybody else to do  it. He bade me take off the wet clothes and put on the  hearse clothes. I did so, and was quickly on my way with  the hearse to the shop.           Though I was but a poor, despised slave, having no  rights that I could call my own, even to the refusal of such  food that I could not eat, yet I possessed that principle of  true manhood to despise deceit in my employers. Here I  found a man who had told me from time to time how to  serve God, how to live right, and now had proved to be a  base deceiver and a falsifier. Instead of the note asking for  turkeys and geese, it was to whip me for what they deemed  impudence. Could I believe him hereafter? Could I trust  him any more? No! he had told me a lie my confidence  in him was gone, and my feelings towards him were  changed. Was I happy or contented? No! for I did not  know how soon another trap would be set for me to fall         into the hands of my enemies. This uncertain state of mind  was my daily, but yet unpleasant, companion. Its duration  was uncertain. I would have felt somewhat at ease if the  boss had inflicted this punishment, but he would not do it.           On December 15 Mr. Mansfield sent me down to the  wharf to Jim Frisby, to get his scow, and proceed up to  Mr. Wallace's and get ten cords of hickory wood. I was  told to take another man with me. As I had to enter  within the bounds of Wallace's estate again, I concluded to  prepare myself for emergencies and a hasty retreat. I had  come to know the trickery of the man I was dealing with  and was determined to disappoint him. Jim Frisby was  an old colored man who owned the scow, and he owned,  besides, a small boat  -  just what was needed, and served my  purpose admirably. While arranging for the scow I also  bargained for the boat, taking care not to divulge my secret  to any one. About ten o'clock we started on our journey.  The distance was but five miles, the tide was running in our  favor, and we were soon at our journey's end. We found  the wood piled up on the shore ready for us. We began to  load up the scow, but night came on us so fast that we could  not finish. We took our lunch into the small boat and  rowed to the other side of the creek, and sought out an old  barn that I had frequently seen in that neighborhood, where  we rested for the night. Being tired after our day's work  we soon sought sweet sleep for our weary bodies.            Next morning we were both up by daylight and resumed  our work, and by nine o'clock we were ready to return with  our load of wood. My readers must not suppose that my  eyes were idle while working here. My hands were working  to serve Mansfield, and my eyes were working or watching     
      immortality of man, while in the flesh: Praying Jacob. This man was a slave in the State of Maryland. His master was very cruel to his slaves. Jacob's rule was to pray three times a day, at just such an hour of the day; no matter what his work was or where he might be, he would stop and go and pray. His master has been to him and pointed his gun at him, and told him if he did not cease praying he would blow out his brains. Jacob would finish his prayer and then tell his master to shoot in welcome--your loss will be my gain--I have two masters, one on earth and one in heaven --master Jesus in heaven, and master Saunders on earth. I have a soul and a body; the body belongs to you, master Saunders, and the soul to master Jesus. Jesus says men ought always to pray, but you will not pray, neither do you want to have me pray. This man said in private conversation that several times he went home and drank an unusual           quantity of brandy to harden his heart that he might kill him; but he never had power to strike nor shoot him, and he would freely give the world, if he had it in his possession for what he believed his Jacob to possess. He also thought that Jacob was as sure of Heaven as the apostle Paul or Peter. Sometimes Mr. S. would be in the field about half drunk, raging like a madman, whipping the other slaves; and when Jacob's hour would come for prayer, he would stop his horses and plough and kneel down and pray; but he could not strike the man of God.             The first Methodist minister that ever preached. in a certain town in Queen Ann's county, there was a great revival of religion among the rich and poor, black and white, free and slaves. When many of them experienced religion they would disobey their ungodly masters and would go to meetings nights and Sundays. Two rich slaveholders waylaid the     
      CHAPTER XV.    SLAVE HOLDERS' CONSISTENT FAMILY WORSHIP    THE SLAVE HOLDERS' MORNING SERVICE.    SLAVEOWNERS' WORSHIP.      Air  -  any long metre.      Come let us join, our God to praise,                  Let us unite in prayer:            Supremely great, and worthy of all adoration art Thou, O  Lord, our heavenly Father. The cattle upon a thousand  hills, and the negroes in a thousand fields are Thine. We          thank Thee, Lord, for the manifold blessings with which Thou  art supplying us, Thine humble and obedient servants, notwithstanding  our merits deserve them all, for Thou hast said  the righteous shall enjoy the good of the land. Now, Lord,  we have not much time to pray, for Thou see'st how those  devilish slaves are squandering away their time. Lord, revive  Thy work in our midst. Grant us all a large increase  of slaves for the traders this fall, that we may obtain the  means, through Thy well directed providence, to rear Thee a  magnificent temple in which Thou wilt love to dwell, and  where Thou wilt love to pour out Thy spirit upon Thy Zion.  O! Lord God, when we go into the fields among those ignorant,  hard headed creatures, (over whom Thou hast made us  to rule), may Thy glory so shine in our countenances that  one of us shall subdue a thousand, and bind ten thousand  upon the racks from the ungovernable malice of enraged  negroes. Deliver us from the influence of a guilty conscience;  deliver us from the abolition creeds, and from the slanderous  tongues of enthusiastic politicians. Deliver us from insurrections  and perplexity of minds, good Lord, deliver us. Give  us and our dogs our daily bread, and our negroes their full  pecks of parched corn or cotton seeds per week. Strengthen  the horse and his rider, and make the limbs of the fugitive  weak. Confound the cunning schemes of anti-slavery men.  Bless the government which Thou didst redeem from the  British yoke of oppression, and didst wash and make clean by  the precious blood of the heroes of '76. Bless the star  spangled banner, which floats over the land of the free and  the home of the brave. May her stars increase in number  and brightness, and eagle's wings be extended o'er all the  virgin soil of our continent until his beak shall pick the fugitive  from his lurking places in the cold regions of British          America, while his tail shall overshadow the slaves in Yucatan.  And may his pinions cast their pleasant shade over all the  free born sons of America, from Providence to Monterey,  while he shall bear in his mighty talons, for ages to come,  four millions of ignorant slaves with all their posterity. Hear  us, good Lord, and according to Thy manifold mercies, bless  and sanctify us. Give us more than we are able to ask for at  this time, and in the end save all the white people who have  supported Thy holy institution and performed Thy will,  through Jesus Christ, our Redeemer, Amen.        SLAVE HOLDERS' CONSISTENT FAMILY WORSHIP.    THE SLAVE HOLDERS' HYMN TO BE SUNG AT EVENING  PRAYERS.  (Short Metre.)      A charge to keep I have,          Copied from imagination's parchment roll, where this, and  many other things, have been on perpetual record from childhood.  Ficticious, as it is, and as ridiculous as it may appear,  I defy any minister, white or black, who preaches to the slaves  in the south, to preach any better doctrines and have his  preaching harmonize with the institution of slavery. The  whole sentiment is consistent with slavery, and the old experienced  southerner will read many things in this discourse  which he has heard before. This is preached more generally  on the Sabbath, previous to the usual holidays by the   Rt. Rev. Bishop Policy.              Well, darkies, I am happy to see so many shining eyes,  and greasy faces today. It speaks two great truths; first, that  you are all awake to your own welfare; and secondly, that  your masters treated you well and gave you meat. You have  come out today to hear the word of God. I hope you will  pay strict attention to what is said, and treasure it up in good  and honest hearts. My text is not taken directly from the  Bible, that is, not our Bible, but yours. We all respect your  Bible more than we do the white man's Bible, or otherwise  the word of God, for your Bible you can obey, but ours you  cannot. The text is recorded in the laws of Maryland, A.  D. 1715, Chapter 44, Section 22.  All negroes and other      
   did set me free.  This must rather be ascribed to his own interest in preserving me from death, as it was very evident I could no longer have survived under such treatment.          After this, though still determined in my own mind to escape, I stayed with him several months, during which he frequently flogged me, but not so severely as before related.  During this time I had opportunity for recovering my health, and using means to heal my wounds. My master's cruelty was not confined to me, it was his general conduct to all his slaves.  I might relate many instances to substantiate this, but will confine myself to one or two.  Mr. Gooch, it is proper to observe, was a member of a Baptist church, called Black Jack Meeting-House,  in Cashaw county, which church I attended  for several years, but was never inside. This is accounted for by the fact, that the coloured population are not permitted to mix with the white population.  Mr. Gooch had a slave named   Phil,*  who was a member of a Methodist church. This man was between seventy and eighty years of age; he was so feeble that he could not accomplish                *This is an abbreviation of Philip.       
     hand; which greatly disappointed my expectant master,  who was looking for me to return in a great fright,  making some very ludicrous demonstration of fear and  alarm. But after a few months more of hardship I  was permitted to return to Capt. Helm's, where I was  treated much better than at Robinson's, and much  better than the Captain used to treat his slaves.           Capt. Helm, not having demand for slave labor as  much as formerly, was in the practice of hiring out  his slaves to different persons, both in and out of the  village; and among others, my only sister was hired  out to a  professed  gentleman living in Bath. She had  become the mother of two or three children, and was  considered a good servant.           One pleasant Sabbath morning, as I was passing the house where she lived, on my way to the Presbyterian church, where I was sent to ring the bell as usual, I  heard the most piteous cries and earnest pleadings  issuing from the dwelling. To my horror and the  astonishment of those with me, my poor sister made her  appearance, weeping bitterly, and followed by her  inhuman master, who was polluting the air of that  clear Sabbath morning, with the most horrid imprecations  and threatenings, and at the same time flourishing  a large raw-hide. Very soon his bottled wrath  burst forth, and the blows, aimed with all his strength, descended upon the unprotected head, shoulders and  back of the helpless woman, until she was literally cut         to pieces. She writhed in his powerful grasp, while  shriek after shriek cried away in heart-rending moanings;  and yet the inhuman demon continued to beat  her, though her pleading cries had ceased, until obliged to desist from the exhaustion of his own  strength.           What a spectacle was that, for the sight of a brother?   The God of heaven only knows the conflict of  feeling I then endured; He alone witnessed the tumult  of my heart, at this outrage of manhood and kindred  affection. God knows that my will was good enough  to have wrung his neck; or to have drained from  his heartless system its last drop of blood!  And yet I  was obliged to turn a deaf ear to her cries for assistance,  which to this day ring in my ears. Strong and  athletic as I was, no hand of mine could be raised in  her defence, but at the peril of both our lives;  -  nor could her husband, had he been a witness of the scene,  be allowed any thing more than unresisting submission  to any cruelty, any indignity which the master  saw fit to inflict on  his wife,  but the other's  slave.            Does any indignant reader feel that I was wanting  in courage or brotherly affection, and say that he  would have interfered, and, at all hazards, rescued his  sister from the power of her master; let him remember  that he is a  freeman ; that he has not from his  infancy been taught to cower beneath the white man's  frown, and bow at his bidding, or suffer all the rigor               of the slave laws. Had the gentlemanly woman-whipper  been seen beating his horse, or his ox, in the  manner he beat my poor sister, and that too for no fault which the law could recognize as an offence, he  would have been complained of most likely; but as it  was, she was but a  slave girl,   -  with whom the  slave law allowed her master to do what he pleased.           Well, I finally passed on, with a clinched fist and contracted brow, to the church, and rung the bell,  I think rather furiously, to notify the inhabitants of Bath, that it was time to assemble for the worship of that God who has declared himself to be  no respecter  of persons.   With my own heart beating wildly  with indignation and sorrow, the kind reader may  imagine my feelings when I saw the smooth-faced  hypocrite, the inhuman slave-whipper, enter the church,  pass quietly on to his accustomed seat, and then  meekly bow his hypocritical face on the damask cushion, in the reverent acknowledgment of that religion  which teaches its adherents  to do unto others as they would be done by,  just as if nothing unusual had happened on that Sabbath morning.  Can any one wonder that I, and other slaves, often doubted the sincerity of every white man's religion? Can it be a matter of astonishment, that slaves often feel that there is no just God for the poor African? Nay, verily; and were it not for the comforting and sustaining influence that these poor, illiterate and suffering             creatures feel as coming from an unearthly  source, they would in their ignorance all become infidels.  To me, that beautiful Sabbath morning  was clouded in midnight darkness, and I retired to ponder  on what could be done.           For some reason or other, Capt. Helm had supplied  every lawyer in that section of country with slaves,  either by purchase or hire; so when I thought of seeking  legal redress for my poor, mangled sister, I saw at  once it would be all in vain. The laws were in favor  of the slave owner, and besides, every legal gentleman  in the village had one or more of the Captain's slaves,  who were treated with more or less rigor; and of course  they would do nothing toward censuring one of their  own number, so nothing could be done to give the  slave even the few privileges which the laws of the  State allowed them.           The Captain sold my aunt Betsy Bristol to a distinguished  lawyer in the village, retaining her husband, Aaron Bristol, in his own employ; and two of her  children he sold to another legal gentleman named  Cruger. One day Captain Helm came out where  the slaves were at work, and finding Aaron was not  there, he fell into a great rage and swore terribly. He  finally started off to a beach tree, from which he cut  a stout limb, and trimmed it so as to leave a knot on  the but end of the stick, or bludgeon rather, which  was about two and a half feet in length. With this          formidable weapon he started for Aaron's lonely cabin.  When the solitary husband saw him coming he suspected  that he was angry, and went forth to meet him  in the street. They had no sooner met than my master  seized Aaron by the collar, and taking the limb he  had prepared by the smaller end, commenced beating  him with it, over the head and face, and struck him  some thirty or more terrible blows in quick succession;  after which Aaron begged to know for what he was so unmercifully flogged.            Because you deserve it,  was the angry reply.  Aaron said that he had ever endeavored to discharge his duty, and had done so to the best of his ability; and that he thought it very hard to be treated in that manner for no offence at all. Capt. Helm was astonished  at his audacity; but the reader will perceive  that the slaves were not blind to the political condition  of the country, and were beginning to feel that they  had some rights, and meant to claim them.           Poor Aaron's face and head, however, was left in a pitiable condition after such a  pummelling  with a knotty stick. His face, covered with blood, was so swollen that he could hardly see for some time; but what of that? Did he not belong to Capt. Helm, soul and body; and if his brutal owner chose to destroy his own property, certainly had he not a right to do so, without let or hindrance? Of course; such is the power that Slavery gives one human being over another.                  And yet it must be confessed that among the poor,  degraded and ignorant slaves there exists a foolish  pride, which loves to boast of their master's  wealth  and influence.  A white person, too poor to own  slaves, is as often looked upon with as much disdain  by the miserable slave as by his wealthy owner.   This disposition seems to be instilled into the mind of  every slave at the South, and indeed, I have heard  slaves object to being sent in very small companies to labor in the field, lest that some passer-by should think that they belonged to a poor man, who was unable to keep a large gang. Nor is this ridiculous  sentiment maintained by the slaves only; the rich planter feels such a contempt for all white persons  without slaves, that he does not want them for his neighbors. I know of many instances where such persons have been under the necessity of buying or hiring slaves, just to preserve their reputation and  keep up appearances; and even among a class of people  who profess to be opposed to Slavery, have I  known instances of the same kind, and have heard  them apologize for their conduct by saying that   when in Rome, we must do as the Romans do.             Uncle Aaron Bristol was one of Capt. Helm's slaves  who lad a large amount of this miserable pride; and for him to be associated with a white man in the same humble occupation, seemed to give him ideas of great  superiority, and full liberty to treat him with all the     
   better for me to leave that country or State, that I might get rid of some of this proscription.           I had now become a young man, and the more I thought, the worse all this appeared, so that every day of my life brought new trials. I knew that I was exposed to a thousand insults from the lowest white man, and resentment upon my part would only bring upon me the vengeance of the State. I felt that I was in the midst of devouring human wolves, though among professed Christians. Though still in the land of my nativity, I was made a stranger. The law of the country knew me as a thing,--the church knew me in the same way. I saw my fellow-countrymen sold out of the church to which I belonged. I saw masters scourge their brother members in the same church, both professedly members of Christ's body. The pastor sold one after another of his flock. The deacons bought and sold slaves. Sermons were preached to justify these wicked deeds. I was made to keep silent; I heard, but I condemned them in my heart. Several slaves ran away from their masters; they were, without delay, excluded for the offence. I concluded I had much better remain at home than to go to chapel, for when I went it only rekindled my hate and fired my temper. Finally, I resolved to leave the State, and after being married I did so.           A letter of dismission was granted to show my membership and good standing, as the document expressed it. On the 11th of March, 1848, I left the State and went to    
            We can never undo the past wrong; but wherever a colored hand, worn out with honest labor, which has never been requited, is stretched out palm up in the midst of Christian plenty, its silent appeal is more pathetic than any language. It seems to come from the body of the race, to bear in its lines the sad story, not of one person, but of the millions buried and forgotten in their unmarked graves. It would be the simplest act of justice to pension all the remaining slaves. The cotton-fields  and rice-swamps of the South would seem then to be yielding the peaceable fruits of righteousness. It would then appear to all mankind that our religion had awakened our seared Christian conscience to the sense of the wrongs done this people.           Dear Aunt Betty! Her race is nearly run. Her sun goes down the sky. How broad the chart from horizon to horizon! Long years of trouble, toil, self-sacrifice, and suffering! May thy sunset be the  sun-rising of a cloudless day, where justice shall compensate thee and thine, and thy independent free spirit, equal to the angels', enjoy forever the freedom of the sons of God!   Your former pastor and wife,   V. A. AND ELIZABETH COOPER.        
     because it is impoverishing and degrading to them and their children.             The slave holders are generally rich, aristocratic, overbearing; and they look with utter contempt upon a poor laboring man, who earns his bread by the  sweat of his brow,  whether he be moral or immoral, honest or dishonest. No matter whether he is white or black; if he performs manual labor for a livelihood, he is looked upon as being inferior to a slaveholder, and but little better off than the slave, who toils without wages under the lash. It is true, that the slaveholder, and non-slaveholder, are living under the same laws in the same State. But the one is rich, the other is poor; one is educated, the other is uneducated; one has houses, land and influence, the other has none. This being the case, that class of the non-slaveholders would be glad to see slavery abolished, but they dare not speak it aloud.             There is much superstition among the slaves. Many of them believe in what they call  conjuration,  tricking, and witchcraft; and some of them pretend to understand the art, and say that by it they can prevent their masters from exercising their will over their slaves. Such are often applied to  by others, to give them power to prevent their masters from flogging them. The remedy is most generally some kind of bitter root; they are directed to chew it and spit towards their masters when they are angry with their slaves. At other times they prepare certain kinds of powders, to sprinkle about their masters dwellings. This is all done for the         purpose of defending themselves in some Peaceable manner, although I am satisfied that there is no virtue at all in it. I have tried it to perfection when I was a slave at the South. I was then a young man, full of life and vigor, and was very fond of visiting our neighbors slaves, but had no time to visit only Sundays, when I could get a permit to go, or after night, when I could slip off without being seen. If it was found out, the next morning I was called up to give an account of myself for going off without permission; and would very often get a flogging for it.             I got myself into a scrape at a certain times, by going off in this way, and I expected to be severely punished for it. I had a strong notion of running off, to escape being flogged, but was advised by a friend to go to one of those conjurers, who could prevent me from being flogged. I went and informed him of the difficulty. He said if I would pay him a small sum, he would prevent my being flogged. After I had paid him, he mixed up some alum, salt and other stuff into a powder, and said I must sprinkle it about my master, if he should offer to strike me; this would prevent him. He also gave me some kind of bitter root to chew, and spit towards him, which would certainly prevent my being flogged. According to order I used his remedy, and for some cause I was let pass without being flogged that time.             I had then great faith in conjuration and witchcraft, I was led to believe that I could do almost as, I pleased, without being flogged. So on the          next Sabbath my conjuration was fully tested by my going off, and staying away until Monday morning, without permission. When I returned home, my master declared that he would punish me for going off; but I did not believe that he could do it, while I had this root and dust; and as he approached me, I commenced talking saucy to him. But he soon convinced me that there was no virtue in them. He soon became so enraged at me for saucing him, that he grasped a handful of switches and punished me severely, in spite of all my roots and powders.             But there was another old slave in that neighborhood, who professed to understand all about conjuration, and I thought I would try his skill. He             told me that the first one was only a quack, and if I would only pay him a certain amount in cash, that he would tell me how to prevent any person from striking me. After I had paid him his charge, he told me to go to the cow-pen after night, and get some fresh cow manure, and mix it with red pepper and white people's hair, all to be put into a pot over the fire, and scorched until it could be ground into snuff. I was then to sprinkle it about my master's bedroom, in his hat and boots, and it would prevent him from ever abusing me in any way. After I got it all ready prepared, the smallest pinch of if scattered over a room, was enough to make a horse sneeze from the strength of it; but it did no good. I tried it to my satisfaction. It was my business to make fires in my master's chamber, night and morning. Whenever I could get a chance, I sprinkled a Little of this dust about the linen of the bed, where          they would breathe it on retiring. This was to act upon them as what is called a kind of love powder, to change their sentiments of anger, to those of love, towards me, but this all proved to be vain imagination. The old man had my money, and I was treated no better for it.             One night when I went in to make a fire, I availed myself of the opportunity of sprinkling a very heavy charge of this powder about my master's bed. Soon after their going to bed, they began to cough and sneeze. Being close around the house, watching and listening, to know what the effect would be, I heard them ask each other what in the world it could be, that made them cough and sneeze so. All the while, I was trembling with fear, expecting every moment I should be called and asked if I knew any thing about it. After this, for fear they might find me out in my dangerous experiments upon them, I had to give them up, for the time being. I was then convinced that running away was the most effectual way by which a slave could escape cruel punishment.             As all the instrumentalities which I as a slave, could bring to bear upon the system, had utterly failed to palliate my sufferings, all hope and consolation fled. I must be a slave for life, and suffer under the lash or die. The influence which this had only tended to make me more unhappy. I resolved that I would be free if running away could make me so. I had heard that Canada was a land of liberty, somewhere in the North; and every wave of trouble that rolled across my breast, caused me     
              The return of the party home was the signal for a hearty laugh, and all at the expense of the city gentleman. So great and disagreeable was the smell, that the young man had to go to the barn, where his clothing was removed, and he submitted to the process of washing by the servants. Soap, scrubbing brushes, towels, indeed, everything was brought into requisition, but all to no purpose. The skunk smell was there, and was likely to remain. Both family and visitors were at the breakfast table, the next morning, except Mr. Sarpee. He was still in the barn, where he had slept the previous night. Nor did there seem to be any hope that he would be able to visit the house, for the smell was intolerable The substitution of a suit of the Doctor's clothes for his own failed to remedy the odor.            Dinkie, the conjurer, was called in. He looked the young man over, shook his head in a knowing manner, and said it was a big job. Mr. Sarpee took out a Mexican silver dollar, handed it to the old negro, and told him to do his best. Dinkie smiled, and he thought that he could remove the smell.            His remedy was to dig a pit in the ground large enough to hold the man, put him in it, and cover him over with fresh earth; consequently, Mr. Sarpee was, after removing his entire clothing, buried, all except his head, while his clothing was served in the same manner. A servant held an umbrella over the unhappy man, and fanned him during the eight hours that he was there.            Taken out of the pit at six o'clock in the evening,         all joined with Dinkie in the belief that Mr. Sarpee  smelt sweeter,  than when interred in the morning; still the smell of the  polecat  was there. Five hours longer in the pit, the following day, with a rub down by Dinkie, with his  Goopher,  fitted the young man for a return home to the city.            I never heard that Mr. Sarpee ever again joined in a  coon hunt.             No description of mine, however, can give anything like a correct idea of the great merriment of the entire slave population on  Poplar Farm,  caused by the  coon hunt.  Even Uncle Ned, the old superannuated slave, who seldom went beyond the confines of his own cabin, hobbled out, on this occasion, to take a look at  de gentleman fum de city,  while buried in the pit.            At night, in the quarters, the slaves had a merry time over the  coon hunt.              I golly, but didn't de polecat give him a big dose?  said Ike.             But how Mr. Sarpee did talk French to hissef when de ole coon peppered him,  remarked Cato.             He won't go coon huntin' agin, soon, I bet you,  said Sam.             De coon hunt,  and  de gemmen fum de city,  was the talk for many days.         
  I told her that Eliza was very dear to me indeed, and that nothing but death should part us. It was the same as if we were married. This had the desired effect. The boat left New Orleans, and proceeded up the river.         I had at different times obtained little sums of money, which I had reserved for a  rainy day.  I procured some cotton cloth, and made me a bag to carry provisions in. The trials of the past were all lost in hopes for the future. The love of liberty, that had been burning in my bosom for years, and had been well-nigh extinguished, was now resuscitated.  At night, when all around was peaceful, I would walk the decks, meditating upon my happy prospects.          I should have stated, that, before leaving St. Louis, I went to an old man named Frank, a slave, owned by a Mr. Sarpee. This old man was very distinguished (not only among the slave population, but also the whites) as a fortune-teller. He was about seventy years of age, something over six feet high, and very slender. Indeed, he was so small around his body, that it looked as though it was not strong enough to hold up his head.                 Uncle Frank was a very great favorite with the young ladies, who would go to him in great numbers to get their fortunes told. And it was generally believed that he could really penetrate into the mysteries of futurity. Whether true or not, he had the  name, and that is about half of what one needs in this gullible age. I found Uncle Frank seated in the chimney corner, about ten o'clock at night. As soon as I entered, the old man left his seat. I watched his movement as well as I could by the dim light of the fire. He soon lit a lamp, and coming up, looked me full in the face, saying,  Well, my son, you have come to get uncle to tell your fortune, have you?    Yes,  said I. But how the old man should know what I came for, I could not tell. However, I paid the fee of twenty-five cents, and he commenced by looking into a gourd, filled with water. Whether the old man was a prophet, or the son of a prophet, I cannot say; but there is one thing certain, many of his predictions were verified.         I am no believer in soothsaying; yet I am sometimes  at a loss to know how Uncle Frank could tell so accurately what would occur in the future. Among the many things he told was one which       was enough to pay me for all the trouble of hunting  him up. It was that I  should be free!  He further said, that in trying to get my liberty I would meet with many severe trials. I thought to myself any fool could tell me that!          The first place in which we landed in a free state was Cairo, a small village at the mouth of the Ohio river. We remained here but a few hours, when we proceeded to Louisville. After unloading some of the cargo, the boat started on her upward trip. The next day was the first of January. I had looked forward to New Year's day as the commencement of a new era in the history of my life. I had decided upon leaving the peculiar institution that day.          During the last night that I served in slavery I did not close my eyes a single moment. When not thinking of the future, my mind dwelt on the past. The love of a dear mother, a dear sister, and three dear brothers, yet living, caused me to shed many tears. If I could only have been assured of their being dead, I should have felt satisfied; but I imagined I saw my dear mother in the cotton-field, followed by a merciless task- master, and no one to speak a consoling word to     
     of punishment to prevent his relieving a brother bondman from hunger and exposure, and therefore, on his own motion, I accompanied him home to his wife--for the house and lot were hers, as she was a free woman. It was about midnight, but his wife was called up, a fire was made, some Indian meal was soon mixed with salt and water, and an ash-cake was baked in a hurry, to relieve my hunger. Sandy's wife was not behind him in kindness; both seemed to esteem it a privilege  to succor me, for although I was hated by Covey and by my master I was loved by the colored people, because they thought I was hated for my knowledge, and persecuted because I was feared. I was the only slave in that region who could read or write. There had been one other man, belonging  to Mr. Hugh Hamilton, who could read, but he, poor fellow,  had shortly after coming into the neighborhood been sold off to the far south. I saw him ironed, in the cart, to be carried to Easton for sale, pinioned like a yearling for the slaughter. My knowledge was now the pride of my brother slaves, and no doubt Sandy felt something of the general interest in me on that account. The supper was soon ready, and though I have since feasted with honorables, lord mayors, and aldermen over the sea, my supper on ash-cake and cold water, with Sandy, was the meal of all my life most sweet to my taste, and now most vivid to my memory.             Supper over, Sandy and I went into a discussion of what was  possible  for me, under the perils and hardships which overshadowed my path. The question was, must I go back to Covey, or must I attempt to run away? Upon a careful survey the latter was found to be impossible; for I was on a narrow neck of land, every avenue from which would bring me in sight of pursuers. There was Chesapeake Bay to the right, and  Pot-pie  river to the left, and St. Michaels and its neighborhood occupied the only space through which there was any retreat.             I found Sandy an old adviser. He was not only a religious man, but he professed to believe in a system for which I have           no name. He was a genuine African, and had inherited some of the so-called magical powers said to be possessed by the eastern nations. He told me that he could help me; that in those very woods there was an herb which in the morning might be found, possessing all the powers required for my protection (I put his words in my own language), and that if I would take his advice he would procure me the root of the herb of which he spoke. He told me, further, that if I would take that root and wear it on my right side it would be impossible  for Covey to strike me a blow; that with this root about my person no white man could whip me. He said he had carried it for years, and that he had fully tested its virtues. He had never received a blow from a slaveholder since he carried it, and he never expected to receive one, for he meant always to carry that root for protection. He knew Covey, well, for Mrs. Covey was the daughter of Mrs. Kemp; and he (Sandy) had heard of the barbarous treatment to which I had been subjected, and he wanted to do something for me.             Now all this talk about the root was to me very absurd and ridiculous, if not positively sinful. I at first rejected the idea that the simple carrying a root on my right side (a root, by the way, over which I walked every time I went into the woods) could possess any such magic power as he ascribed to it, and I was, therefore, not disposed to cumber my pocket with it. I had a positive aversion to all pretenders to   divination .   It was beneath one of my intelligence to countenance  such dealings with the devil as this power implied. But with all my learning--it was really precious little--Sandy was more than a match for me.  My book-learning  he said,  had not kept Covey off me  (a powerful argument just then), and he entreated me, with flashing eyes, to try this. If it did me no good it could do me no harm, and it would cost me nothing any way. Sandy was so earnest and so confident of the good qualities of this weed that, to please him, I was induced to take it. He had been to me the good Samaritan, and had, almost providentially, found me and           helped me when I could not help myself; how did I know but that the hand of the Lord was in it? With thoughts of this sort I took the roots from Sandy and put them in my righthand pocket.             This was of course Sunday morning. Sandy now urged me to go home with all speed, and to walk up bravely to the house, as though nothing had happened. I saw in Sandy too deep an insight into human nature, with all his superstition, not to have some respect for his advice; and perhaps, too, a slight gleam or shadow of his superstition had fallen on me. At any rate, I started off toward Covey's as directed. Having, the previous night, poured my griefs into Sandy's ears and enlisted him in my behalf, having made his wife a sharer in my sorrows, and having also become well refreshed by sleep and food, I moved off quite courageously toward the dreaded Covey's. Singularly enough, just as I entered the yard gate I met him and his wife, dressed in their Sunday best, looking as smiling as angels, on their way to church. His manner perfectly astonished me. There was something really benignant  in his countenance. He spoke to me as never before, told me that the pigs had got into the lot and he wished me to go to drive them out; inquired how I was, and seemed an altered man. This extraordinary conduct really made me begin to think that Sandy's herb had more virtue in it than I, in my pride, had been willing to allow, and had the day been other than Sunday I should have attributed Covey's altered manner solely to the power of the root. I suspected, however, that the  Sabbath , not the root, was the real explanation of the change. His religion hindered him from breaking the Sabbath,  but not from breaking my skin on any other day than Sunday. He had more respect for the day than for the man for whom the day was mercifully given; for while he would out and slash my body during the week, he would on Sunday teach me the value of my soul, and the way of life and salvation  by Jesus Christ. All went well with me till Monday morning; and then,           whether the root had lost its virtue, or whether my tormentor had gone deeper into the black art than I had (as was sometimes said of him), or whether he had obtained a special indulgence  for his faithful Sunday's worship, it is not necessary for me to know or to inform the reader; but this much I may say, the pious and benignant smile which graced the face of Covey on  Sunday  wholly disappeared on  Monday .             Long before daylight I was called up to go feed, rub, and curry the horses. I obeyed the call, as I should have done had it been made at an earlier hour, for I had brought my mind to a firm resolve during that Sunday's reflection to obey every order, however unreasonable, if it were possible, and if Mr. Covey should then undertake to beat me to defend and protect myself to the best of my ability. My religious views on the subject of resisting my master had suffered a serious shock by the savage persecution to which I had been subjected, and my hands were no longer tied by my religion. Master Thomas' indifference had severed the last link. I had backslidden  from this point in the slaves' religious creed, and I soon had occasion to make my fallen state known to my  Sunday-pious brother, Covey.             While I was obeying his order to feed and get the horses ready for the field, and when I was in the act of going up the stable loft, for the purpose of throwing down some blades, Covey sneaked into the stable, in his peculiar way, and seizing me suddenly by the leg, he brought me to the stable-floor, giving my newly-mended body a terrible jar. I now forgot all about my  roots , and remembered my pledge to stand up in my own defense. The brute was skilfully endeavoring  to get a slip-knot on my legs, before I could draw up my feet. As soon as I found what he was up to, I gave a sudden spring (my two days' rest had been of much service to me) and by that means, no doubt, he was able to bring me to the floor so heavily. He was defeated in his plan of tying me. While down, he seemed to think he had me very securely in his power. He little thought he was--as the rowdies say           -- in  for a  rough and tumble  fight: but such was the fact. Whence came the daring spirit necessary to grapple with a man, who eight-and-forty hours before, could, with his slightest word, have made me tremble like a leaf in a storm, I do not know; at any rate I was  resolved to fight , and what was better still, I actually was hard at it. The fighting madness  had come upon me, and I found my strong fingers firmly attached to the throat of the tyrant, as heedless of consequences,  at the moment, as if we stood as equals before the law. The very color of the man was forgotten. I felt supple as a cat, and was ready for him at every turn. Every blow of his was parried, though I dealt no blows in return. I was strictly on the  defensive , preventing him from injuring me, rather than trying to injure him, I flung him on the ground several times when he meant to have hurled me there. I held him so firmly by the throat that his blood followed my nails. He held me, and I held him.             All was fair thus far, and the contest was about equal. My resistance was entirely unexpected, and Covey was taken all aback by it, and he trembled in every limb.   Are you going to resist , you scoundrel?  said he. To which I returned a polite  yes, sir ,  steadily gazing my interrogator in the eye, to meet the first approach or dawning of the blow which I expected my answer would call forth. But the conflict did not long remain equal. Covey soon cried lustily for help; not that I was obtaining any marked advantage over him, or was injuring him, but because he was gaining none over me, and was not able, single-handed, to conquer me. He called for his cousin Hughes to come to his assistance, and now the scene was changed. I was compelled to give blows, as well as to parry them, and since I was in any case to suffer for resistance, I felt (as the musty proverb goes) that I  might as well be hanged for an old sheep as a lamb.  I was still defensive toward Covey, but aggressive toward Hughes, on whom at his first approach, I dealt a blow which fairly sickened him.  He went off, bending over with pain, and manifesting      
   Sandy was too generous to permit the fear of punishment to prevent his relieving a brother bondman from hunger and exposure; and, therefore, on his own motion, I accompanied him to his home, or rather to the home of his wife--for the house and lot were hers. His wife was called up--for it was now about mid-night--a fire was made, some Indian meal was soon mixed with salt and water, and an ash cake was baked in a hurry to relieve my hunger. Sandy's wife was not behind him in kindness--both seemed to esteem it a privilege to succor me; for, although I was hated by Covey and by my master, I was loved by the colored people, because  they  thought I was hated for my knowledge, and persecuted because I was feared. I was the  only  slave  now  in that region who could read and write. There had been one other man, belonging to Mr. Hugh Hamilton, who could read, (his name was  Jim, ) but he, poor fellow, had, shortly after my coming into the neighborhood, been sold off to the far south. I saw Jim ironed, in the cart, to be carried to Easton for sale,--pinioned like a yearling for the slaughter. My knowledge was now the pride of my brother slaves; and, no doubt, Sandy felt something of the general interest in me on that account. The supper was soon ready, and though I have feasted since, with honorables, lord mayors and aldermen, over the sea, my supper on ash cake and cold water, with Sandy, was the meal, of all my life, most sweet to my taste, and now most vivid in my memory.

If it did me no good, it could do me no harm, and it would cost me nothing, any way. Sandy was so earnest, and so confident of the good qualities of this weed, that, to please him, rather than from any conviction of its excellence, I was induced to take it. He had been to me the good Samaritan, and had, almost providentially, found me, and helped me when I could not help myself; how did I know but that the hand of the Lord was in it? With thoughts of this sort, I took the roots from Sandy, and put them in my right hand pocket.           This was, of course, Sunday morning.

He called for his cousin Hughes, to come to his assistance, and now the scene was changed. I was compelled to give blows, as well as to parry them; and, since I was, in any case, to suffer for resistance, I felt (as the musty proverb goes) that  I might as well be hanged for an old sheep as a lamb.  I was still  defensive  toward Covey, but  aggressive  toward Hughes; and, at the first approach of the latter, I dealt a blow, in my desperation, which fairly sickened my youthful assailant. He went off, bending over with pain, and manifesting no disposition to come within my reach again. The poor fellow was in the act of trying to catch and tie my right hand, and while flattering himself with success, I gave him the kick which sent him staggering away in pain, at the same time that I held Covey with a firm hand.           Taken completely by surprise, Covey seemed to        have lost his usual strength and coolness. He was frightened, and stood puffing and blowing, seemingly unable to command words or blows. When he saw that poor Hughes was standing half bent with pain--his courage quite gone--the cowardly tyrant asked if I  meant to persist in my resistance.  I told him  I  did mean to resist, come what might;   that I had been by him treated like a  brute,  during the last six months; and that I should stand it  no longer.  With that, he gave me a shake, and attempted to drag me toward a stick of wood, that was lying just outside the stable door. He meant to knock me down with it; but, just as he leaned over to get the stick, I seized him with both hands by the collar, and, with a vigorous and sudden snatch, I brought my assailant harmlessly, his full length, on the  not over  clean ground--for we were now in the cow yard. He had selected the place for the fight, and it was but right that he should have all the advantages of his own selection.           By this time, Bill, the hired man, came home. He had been to Mr. Hemsley's, to spend the Sunday with his nominal wife, and was coming home on Monday morning, to go to work. Covey and I had been skirmishing from before daybreak, till now, that the sun was almost shooting his beams over the eastern woods, and we were still at it. I could not see where the matter was to terminate. He evidently was afraid to let me go, lest I should again make off to the woods; otherwise, he would probably have obtained arms from the house, to frighten me. Holding me, Covey called upon Bill for assistance. The scene here, had something comic about it.  Bill,  who knew  precisely         what Covey wished him to do, affected ignorance, and pretended he did not know what to do.  What shall I do, Mr. Covey,  said Bill.  Take hold of him--take hold of him!  said Covey. With a toss of his head, peculiar to Bill, he said,  indeed, Mr. Covey, I want to go to work.    This is  your work,  said Covey;  take hold of him.  Bill replied, with spirit,  My master hired me here, to work, and  not  to help you whip Frederick.  It was now my turn to speak.  Bill,  said I,  don't put your hands on me.  To which he replied,  MY GOD! Frederick, I aint goin' to tech ye,  and Bill walked off, leaving Covey and myself to settle our matters as best we might.           But, my present advantage was threatened when I saw Caroline (the slave-woman of Covey) coming to the cow yard to milk, for she was a powerful woman, and could have mastered me very easily, exhausted as I now was. As soon as she came into the yard, Covey attempted to rally her to his aid. Strangely--and, I may add, fortunately--Caroline was in no humor to take a hand in any such sport. We were all in open rebellion, that morning. Caroline answered the command of her master to   take hold of me,   precisely as Bill had answered, but in  her,  it was at greater peril so to answer; she was the slave of Covey, and he could do what he pleased with her. It was  not  so with Bill, and Bill knew it. Samuel Harris, to whom Bill belonged, did not allow his slaves to be beaten, unless they were guilty of some crime which the law would punish. But, poor Caroline, like myself, was at the mercy of the merciless Covey; nor        did she escape the dire effects of her refusal. He gave her several sharp blows.           Covey at length (two hours had elapsed) gave up the contest. Letting me go, he said,--puffing and blowing at a great rate-- now, you scoundrel, go to your work; I would not have whipped you half so much as I have had you not resisted.  The fact was,  he had not whipped me at all.  He had not, in all the scuffle, drawn a single drop of blood from me. I had drawn blood from him; and, even without this satisfaction, I should have been victorious, because my aim had not been to injure him, but to prevent his injuring me.           During the whole six months that I lived with Covey, after this transaction, he never laid on me the weight of his finger in anger. He would, occasionally, say he did not want to have to get hold of me again--a declaration which I had no difficulty in believing; and I had a secret feeling, which answered,  you need not wish to get hold of me again, for you will be likely to come off worse in a second fight than you did in the first.            Well, my dear reader, this battle with Mr. Covey,--undignified as it was, and as I fear my narration of it is--was the turning point in my   life as a slave.   It rekindled in my breast the smouldering embers of liberty; it brought up my Baltimore dreams, and revived a sense of my own manhood. I was a changed being after that fight. I was  nothing  before; I WAS A MAN NOW. It recalled to life my crushed self-respect and my self-confidence, and inspired me with a renewed determination to be A FREEMAN. A man, without        force, is without the essential dignity of humanity. Human nature is so constituted, that it cannot  honor  a helpless man, although it can  pity  him; and even this it cannot do long, if the signs of power do not arise.           He only can understand the effect of this combat on my spirit, who has himself incurred something, hazarded something, in repelling the unjust and cruel aggressions of a tyrant. Covey was a tyrant, and a cowardly one, withal. After resisting him, I felt as I had never felt before. It was a resurrection from the dark and pestiferous tomb of slavery, to the heaven of comparative freedom. I was no longer a servile coward, trembling under the frown of a brother worm of the dust, but, my long-cowed spirit was roused to an attitude of manly independence. I had reached the point, at which I was  not afraid to die.  This spirit made me a freeman in  fact,  while I remained a slave in  form.  When a slave cannot be flogged he is more than half free. He has a domain as broad as his own manly heart to defend, and he is really   a power on earth.   While slaves prefer their lives, with flogging, to instant death, they will always find christians enough, like unto Covey, to accommodate that preference. From this time, until that of my escape from slavery, I was never fairly whipped. Several attempts were made to whip me, but they were always unsuccessful. Bruises I did get, as I shall hereafter inform the reader; but the case I have been describing, was the end of the brutification to which slavery had subjected me.           The reader will be glad to know why, after I had        so grievously offended Mr. Covey, he did not have me taken in hand by the authorities; indeed, why the law of Maryland, which assigns hanging to the slave who resists his master, was not put in force against me; at any rate, why I was not taken up, as is usual in such cases, and publicly whipped, for an example to other slaves, and as a means of deterring me from committing the same offense again. I confess, that the easy manner in which I got off, was, for a long time, a surprise to me, and I cannot, even now, fully explain the cause.           The only explanation I can venture to suggest, is the fact, that Covey was, probably, ashamed to have it known and confessed that he had been mastered by a boy of sixteen. Mr. Covey enjoyed the unbounded and very valuable reputation, of being a first rate overseer and  negro breaker.  By means of this reputation, he was able to procure his hands for  very trifling  compensation, and with very great ease. His interest and his pride mutually suggested the wisdom of passing the matter by, in silence. The story that he had undertaken to whip a lad, and had been resisted, was, of itself, sufficient to damage him; for his bearing should, in the estimation of slaveholders, be of that imperial order that should make such an occurrence  impossible.  I judge from these circumstances, that Covey deemed it best to give me the go-by. It is, perhaps, not altogether creditable to my natural temper, that, after this conflict with Mr. Covey, I did, at times, purposely aim to provoke him to an attack, by refusing to keep with the other hands in the field,     
    house. He was very angry with me: he cursed me and asked me where I had been. I told him I had been asleep in the stable. He told me I lied, and that I had attempted to make my escape; threatening to whip me. I told him I had not attempted any thing of the kind; but he would not believe me. Here again I was in great trouble. I went to bed and slept as well as I could, which was but little. The next day we again pursued our journey, and nothing of any consequence, different from what had before taken place, until we arrived at Savannah, which was in about six weeks. As we entered the city, we were about to pass a man who had a gun on his shoulder, loaded with shot. It accidentally went off, the contents within a very few inches of me. Here again, I escaped a wound, if not death. After residing in Savannah for a few months, and perceiving that he grew more severe and inhuman with me every day, I began to despair of ever living with him in peace. I however found some friends in Savannah, after a short time, and they advised me (after being made acquainted with the manner in which I was used) to get away from him as soon as possible. He would never allow me to leave the yard, unless it was for the purpose of taking out his horses to exercise them. At such times, I would often go to the fortune-teller, and by paying her twenty-five cents, she would tell me what she said my fortune would be. She told me I should eventually get away, but that it would be attended with a great deal of trouble; and truly, I experienced a vast deal of trouble before I could get away.            I will state to my readers some facts relative to the treatment I received from him, and others, during the time I lived there. He had an old black female slave whom he called Frankee. I always believed her to be a witch: circumstances to prove this, I shall hereafter state. He also had at one time, a number of carpenters at work in his yard. One of them, a man about my size, and resembling me very much in his dress, being dressed in a blue round-about jacket. He came into the yard to his work one morning, with an umbrella in his hand. This old woman saw him come in, and thinking it was me, or pretending so to do, was the cause of my receiving a severe whipping, in the following manner. My master having mislaid his umbrella, had been looking for it for some time, and on enquiring of her about it, she told him that she saw me come into the yard with it in my hand. I was then in the yard; he called to me, and said, where have you been sir? I replied,          only to work about the yard sir. He then asked me where I was all night with his umbrella. I told him I had not been out of the yard, nor had I seen his umbrella. He said I was a liar, and that I had taken his umbrella away, and was seen to return with it in my hand this morning when coming into the yard. I told him it was not so, and that I knew nothing about it. He immediately fell foul of me with a large stick, and beat me most unmercifully, until I really thought he would kill me. I begged of him to desist, as I was perfectly innocent. He not believing me, still continued to beat me, until his strength was entirely exhausted. Some time after this, my mistress found his umbrella where she had placed it herself, having removed it from the place where he had left it, and gave it to him, saying, you have beat him for nothing, he was innocent of it. I was afterwards informed by another servant, of the circumstance. I then went to my master, and told him that he had beaten me most unmercifully, for a crime I was not guilty of, all through the insinuation of that old woman. He replied,  no, by Gad, I never hit you a blow amiss; if you did not deserve it now, you did some other time.  I told him she must have been drunk or she would not have told him such a story. He said that could not be, as she never was allowed to have any liquor by her. I told him to look in her chest, and convince himself. He then enquired of her if she had any rum. She said, no sir, I have not a drop. I then told him that if he would look in her chest, he would find it. He accordingly went, and found it. He then said to her, hey, you old bitch  I  have caught you in a lie. On this same account she appeared to be determined to kill me, by some means or other.  I  slept in the same room with her under the kitchen. My blankets were on the floor. She had a straw bed on a bed-stead about four paces from mine. My master slept directly over my head.  I  have heretofore stated that  I  was convinced that this creature was a witch, and would turn herself into almost any different shape she chose.  I  have at different times of the night felt a singular sensation, such as people generally call the night-mare:  I  would feel her coming towards me, and endeavouring to make a noise, which  I  could quite plainly at first; but the nearer she approached me the more faintly  I  would cry out.  I  called to her, aunt Frankee, aunt Frankee, as plain as  I  could, until she got upon me and began to exercise her enchantments on me.  I  was then entirely speechless; making a noise like one apparently choking, or strangling.         My master had often heard me make this noise in the night, and had called to me, to know what was the matter; but as long as she remained there I could not answer. She would then leave me and go to her own bed. After my master had called to her a number of times. Frankee, Frankee, when she got to her own bed, she would answer, sair. What ails Theo? (a name I went by there, cutting short the name Theodore) She answered, hag ride him sair. He then called to me, telling me to go and sleep with her. I could then, after she had left me, speak myself, and also have use of my limbs. I got up, and went to her bed, and tried to get under her coverlid; but could not find her. I found her bed clothes wet. I kept feeling for her, but could not find her. Her bed was tumbled from head to foot. I was then convinced she was a witch, and that she rode me. I then lay across the corner of her bed without any covering, because I thought she would not dare to ride me on her own bed, although she was a witch. I have often, at the time she started from her own bed, in some shape or other, felt a shock, and the nigher she advanced towards me, the more severe the shock would be. The next morning my master asked me what was the matter of me last night. I told him that some old witch rode me, and that old witch, is no other than old Frankee. He cursed me and called me a damned fool, and told me that if he heard any more of it, he would whip me. I then knew he did not believe in witch-craft. He said, why dont she ride me? I will give her a dollar. Ride me you old hag, and I will give you a dollar. I told him she would not dare to ride him.            One morning after he had given me such a severe pounding concerning the umbrella, and I was determined not to stay with him long, but to get away from him as soon as possible; he ordered me to fetch up my horse and saddle him, and put the other horse to the chaise, in order to go out to Bonaventure. I did so, and whilst I was gone I tried to invent some project, to make him believe me unwell. The next morning I pretended to be sick. He asked me what the matter was with me. I told him I had a pain in my side. He then said to Miss A--, go and weigh out a pound of salts for him. She did so. He then came to me with the salts in a cup, and said, do you see this sir? Do you see this? By Gad, you shall take every bit of this. He then mixed up a slight dose and gave it to me, which I took. He then sent for a doctor, who came and felt my pulse, and then said it would be well enough to put      
    missing me, and thinking I had run away, made a thorough search for me, but could not find me until I awoke and went into the house. He was very angry with me: he cursed me and asked me where I had been. I told him I had been asleep in the stable. He told me I lied, and that I had attempted to make my escape; threatening to whip me. I told him I had not attempted any thing of the kind; but he would not believe me. Here, again, I was in great trouble. I went to bed and slept as well as I could, which was but little.             The next day we pursued our journey, and nothing of any consequence occurred, different from what had before taken place, until we arrived at Savannah, which was in about six weeks. As we entered the city, we were about to pass a man who had a gun on his shoulder, loaded with shot. It accidentally went off, the contents within a very few inches of me. Here, again, I escaped a wound, if not death. After residing in Savannah for a few months, and perceiving that he grew more severe and inhuman with me every day, I began to despair of ever living with him in peace. I however found some friends in Savannah, after a short time, and they advised me (after being made acquainted with the manner in which I was used) to get away from him as soon as possible. He would never allow me to leave the yard, unless it was for the purpose of taking out his horses to exercise them. At such times, I would often go to the fortune-teller, and by paying her twenty-five cents, she would tell me what she said my fortune would be. She told me I should eventually get away, but that it would be attended with a great deal of trouble; and truly, I experienced a vast deal of trouble before I could get away.             I will state to my readers some facts relative to the treatment I received from him, and others, during the time I lived there. He had an old black female slave whom he called Frankee. I always believed her to be a witch: circumstances to prove this, I shall hereafter state. He also had, at one time, a number of carpenters         at work in his yard. One of them was a man about my size, and resembling me very much in dress, being dressed in a blue roundabout jacket. He came into the yard to his work one morning, with an umbrella in his hand. This old woman saw him come in, and thinking it was me, or pretending so to do, was the cause of my receiving a severe whipping, in the following manner. My master having mislaid his umbrella, had been looking for it for some time, and on inquiring of her about it, she told him that she saw me come into the yard with it in my hand. I was then in the yard; he called to me, and said, where have you been, sir? I replied, only to work about the yard, sir. He then asked me where I was all night with his umbrella? I told him I had not been out of the yard, nor had I seen his umbrella. He said I was a liar, and that I had taken his umbrella away, and was seen to return with it in my hand this morning when coming into the yard. I told him it was not so, and that I knew nothing about it. He immediately fell foul of me with a large stick, and beat me most unmercifully, until I really thought he would kill me. I begged of him to desist as I was perfectly innocent. He not believing me, still continued to beat me, until his strength was entirely exhausted. Some time after this, my mistress found his umbrella where she had placed it herself, having removed it from the place where he had left it, and gave it to him, saying, you have beat him for nothing--he was innocent of it. I was afterwards informed by another servant of the circumstance.

My master had often heard me make this noise in the night, and had called to me, to know what was the matter; but as long as she remained there I could not answer. She would then leave me and go to her own bed. After my master had called to her a number, of times, Frankee! Frankee! what ails Theo? (a name I went by there, cutting short the name Theodore,) she answered, hag ride him, sair. He then called to me, telling me to go and sleep with her. I could then, after she had left me, speak myself, and also have use of my limbs. I got up and went to her bed, and tried to get under her coverlid; but not find her. I found her bedclothes wet.

He then sent for a doctor, who came and felt my pulse, and then said it would be well enough to put a blister plaister on my side. He accordingly went home, spread a very large plaister, and sent it over, which my master caused to be put on my side, which drew a large blister there. All this I bore without being sick or unwell, in the least. There was a man who had been to him repeatedly to see if he would sell me. He always refused, saying, no, I did not buy him to sell; and I will be damned if I do sell him,--I bought him for my own use. I saw that he knew I was determined to get a new master, and, he was the more determined to keep me. At length I refused to eat any thing, at all. He would often ask me why I would not eat. I answered him that I could not, I was very weak and unwell.     
      trap. They soon surrounded the boys and had them; but suddenly Adam made a dash, and was gone over a fence into a field with the men flying after him, but all to no effect. With Adam's dash several of the others followed. So, after all, the main birds--big birds--were out of danger. These patrolers, however, had the small boys, whom they gave a light brushing. Then, pushing south, they passed within twenty feet of me and three others without knowing it. That was the closest I ever got to any patrolers. While waiting in our hiding place the other boys came along, feeling quite sad that they had missed their dance and had caught a thrashing. In fact, there was no ball that night. We came out of our hiding place and joined them in their homeward tramp, but did not talk much until the next day. Adam turned up all right next morning. A nine-mile walk and run was all he enjoyed that night.             Uncle Charles Hall was a kind of hoodoo. He could prevent the white folks from mistreating you, hence those of us who could believe in such would visit him and have him  fix  us. He would make us  jacks  and direct us where to get certain kinds of roots to chew and to anoint with three times daily. This we did, for Mr. Golden, the overseer, was pretty tight on us. The most amusing sight was presented when the overseer would ride among us. Every little fellow would begin to chew his root and spit toward the overseer. One day Noah spit too close to him, and he took offense at it; and in spite of Noah's roots the overseer  wore him out.  I laughed so that the overseer, not knowing why I laughed, turned on me; but I could not help it, for I would have laughed at any      [missing pages 35-38]         version="1.0"?>        M. F.

[Cover Image]          [Title               not know or imagine how sad a place the hospital is unless he himself has suffered in one of them. I suppose there must have been more than two hundred patients there, and they were of the very sickest nature too. I was not a Christian, yet I felt as though I were willing to die. I cannot say that I would have been saved, because I knew not Christ as my only Saviour. I went home in my visions, and every time I dropped into a slumber I was happy and merry with brother. But O there was a sight which greeted my eyes which was most appalling! The dead were being carried out night and day, many of whom were being poisoned to death by wicked doctors and cruel nurses. These nurses seemed to have been devoid of souls. They had lost all sympathy for the suffering, and if the sick were restless they would whip them with straps; and if that failed to quiet them a kind of red medicine, which never failed to kill within three hours, was given them. How sad was the sight! There were two colored men in my room as nurses. One of them said to me:  My child, you must grin and endure it; but avoid making a noise or they will kill you.  I heeded that advice as best I could. Finally the doctor visited me and remarked in my hearing:  He is a sick lad.  I told him by my pitiable looks to help me or I would die. He turned to the nurses and directed them to cup my head. This was very painful at first, but finally gave ease. I was lying quietly one day when one of the colored nurses said that I was getting better and asked me what I would give him to have me well enough to go home at a certain time.  All I've got, sir,  was my reply. And just as sure as that time came I was well           and ready to go out of the hospital. God bless that man! And yet he was no voodoo.             Imagine the feelings of the men, who had heard that I was dead, when I met them at supper one night. Indeed, some of them could not help but shed tears of joy. I was going home, and we slept but little that night. All sent some word home by me. On Friday evening I boarded the Reindeer and was off for Selma. Reaching that city Sunday morning, I laid over until Monday morning; then, taking the cars for Talladega, I was soon flying homeward. I walked in on mother without her being aware of my coming.             I have not space to give my readers an account of the cruelty to the hands on the breastworks, but must close this part of my narrative by saying that I providentially received nothing but kindness during my stay there save a scolding given me one day by Mr. Thomas Green, the boss, for which I cried most heartily. Old Mr. Green went from our neighborhood as boss in charge of the hands from our section. He was a clever gentleman, and a scolding from him went as hard with me as a whipping. It was on account of the tenderness of heart of his sub-boss that I was put to carrying water, he having seen that I was not strong enough to roll a wheelbarrow up the steep inclined plane. Not knowing this, Mr. Green gave me the harsh scolding, telling me that if I didn't get a wheelbarrow and get to work he would give me a flogging. I got the barrow, but could not wheel it. By this time General Armstrong, the field marshal, with his aides, came riding up to inspect things. The sub-boss hurried me off after water, thus saving me from being killed, as General      
   was very angry at his son Thomas, and his punishment was, that he was driven from his plantation with orders never to return, and that he should not have any of his property. This seemed to grieve Thomas very much, and he made several attempts to regain his father's affections, but failed. Finally, one night, Thomas made an outcry that he had found a pearl of great price, that the Lord had pardoned his sins, and that he was at peace with all mankind. When his father heard of this he sent for him to come home, and he gave him quite a sum of money and willed him the portion of property that he said he should keep from him. But poor Jim was not there to forgive him.      A MAN MISTAKEN FOR A HOG.           Two negroes went to steal hogs from their master, they were under a barn, as in the South barns were made high enough for hogs to stand under. The man who went under the barn said to the other, you must strike the hog that goes the slowest, then he went under the barn on his knees to drive them out while the other stood with his club ready to strike, but they ran out so fast he could not hit them except the last as he thought, which came just slow enough and he struck, while the supposed hog was kicking, he jumped upon it to stab it with his knife but found it was his companion.      CUSTOM OF WITCHES AMONG SLAVES.           The witches among slaves were supposed to have        been persons who worked with them every day, and were called old hags or jack lanterns. Those, both men and women, who, when they grew old looked odd, were supposed to be witches. Sometimes after eating supper the negroes would gather in each other's cabins which looked over the large openings on the plantation, and when they would see a light at a great distance and saw it open and shut they would say  there is an old hag,  and if it came from a certain direction where those lived whom they called witches, one would say  dat looks like old Aunt Susan,  another said  no, dat look like man hag,  still another  I tink dat look like ole Uncle Renty.            When the light disappeared they said that the witch had got into the plantation and changed itself into a person, and went around on the place talking with the people like others until those whom it wanted to bewitch went to bed, then it would change itself to a witch again. They claimed that they rode human beings like horses, and the spittle that run on the side of the cheek when one slept was the bridle that the witch rode with. Sometimes a baby would be smothered by its mother and they would charge it to a witch. If they went out hunting at night and were lost it was believed that a witch led them off, especially if they fell into a pond or creek. I was very much troubled with witches when a little boy and am now sometimes, but it is only when I eat a hearty supper and then go to bed. It was said by some of the slaves that        the witches would sometimes go into the rooms of the cabins and hide themselves until the family went to bed, and when any one claimed that they went into the apartment before bed time and thought he saw a witch, if they had an old bible in the cabin that would be taken into the room and the person who carried the bible would say as he went in  In de name of de Fader and of de Son and de Hole Gos wat you want?  then the bible would be put in the corner where the person thought he saw the witch as it was generally believed that if this were done the witch could not stay. When they could not get the bible they used red pepper and salt pounded together and scattered in the room, but in this case they generally felt the effects of it more than the witch, for when they went to bed it made them cough all night. When I was a little boy my mother sent me into the cabin room for something, and as I got in I saw something black and white, but did not stop to see what it was, and running out said there was a witch in the room, but father having been born in Africa did not believe in such things, so he called me a fool and whipped me and the witch got scared and ran out of the door; it turned out to be our own black and white cat that we children played with every day. Although it proved to be the cat, and father did not believe in witches, still I held the idea that there were such things, for I thought as the majority of the people believed it that they ought to know more than one man. Sometime after I was free, in traveling from       Columbia to Camden, a distance of about thirty-two miles; night overtook me when about half way there, it was very dark and rainy, and as I approached a creek I saw a great number of lights of those witches opening and shutting, I did not know what to do and thought of turning back, but when I looked behind I saw some witches in the distance, so I said if I turn back those will meet me and I will be in as much danger as if I go on, and I thought of what some of my fellow negroes had said about their leading men into ponds and creeks; there was a creek just ahead, so I concluded that I should be drowned that night, however I went on, as I saw no chance of turning back. When I came near the creek one of the witches flew into my face; I jumped back and grasped it, but it proved to be one of those little lightning bugs, and I thought if all the witches were like that one I should not be in any great danger from them.      THE DEATH OF CYRUS AND STEPNEY.           Old Col. Dick Singleton had several state places which I have mentioned before, however, I will explain them again. In the South the rich men who had a great deal of money bought all the plantation they could get and obtained them very cheap. The Colonel had some ten or twenty places and had slaves settled on each of them.           He had four children, and after each had received a plantation the rest were called state places and these could not be sold until all of the grandchildren     
                Did any of the black people on his place believe in the teachings of their master?               No, my child; none of us listened to him about singing and praying. I tell you we used to have some good times together praying and singing. He did not want us to pray, but we would have our little prayer-meeting anyhow. Sometimes when we met to hold our meetings we would put a big wash-tub full of water in the middle of the floor to catch the sound of our voices when we sung. When we all sung we would march around and shake each other's hands, and we would sing easy and low, so marster could not hear us. O, how happy I used to be in those meetings, although I was a slave! I thank the Lord Aunt Jane Lee lived by me. She helped me to make my peace with the Lord. O, the day I was converted! It seemed to me it was a paradise here below! It looked like I wanted nothing any more. Jesus was so sweet to my soul! Aunt Jane used to sing, 'Jesus! the name that charms our fears.' That hymn just suited my case. Sometimes I felt like preaching myself. It seemed I wanted to ask every body if they loved Jesus when I first got converted. I wanted to ask     
   and, after a conference, Schenk called Quamino into the parlor, and queried whether he would like to see his father and mother, his master and mistress, his young masters and mistresses,  c. On his giving an affirmative reply, he was told:-- Well, your master has sent for you, and this man has come to take you.  Overcome with this too sudden announcement, he burst into a violent and uncontrollable fit of crying, and for hours cried aloud as though he had been beaten--unable to answer questions, or to stay his emotions at the kindest efforts to pacify him.  Oh,  said his master,  the shock was too much for him.  And he continued to sob the remainder of the day, whilst endeavouring to perform his work. As he related it, in his venerable age, to the writer, he was asked whether it was joy that affected him. He replied,  It seems so, sir--I don't know, and  I didn't know then --it struck me to the heart.            On his return to Jersey, his young associates were so grown beyond his knowledge, that he felt like a stranger in his childish haunts.           When nearing the age of manhood, he was steady in his attendance upon religious meetings, walking several miles through all kinds of weather. His own account of the motive for going was, that he  liked to have the name of being a good boy.  One Sabbath evening, returning home from meeting, he had impressions of a striking character; his imagination being evidently much acted upon.        As he trod the familiar way, a new road appeared to branch off to the right hand, leading up the mountain. Intent on pursuing it, he hastened to look into it, and saw distinctly  a dry, smooth path,  leading upward as far as he could see; but, as  he was about to enter it, (to quote the old man's own words,)  I heard a noise like half-a-dozen horses, coming after me, rattling as hard as they could lay their legs on the ground.  He turned his head, and the illusion was broken. The old man's tears trickled, as he said,  and there, sir, I lost it! I thought,  said he,  that it was a token for something or other.  On reaching home, the family were in bed, and he went to the barn, where, after earnest exercise in prayer, he slept upon the straw. Very early in the morning, he went into the field to work, first kneeling by the fence. Being in much distress, the gracious words of the Saviour were distinctly revived to him,  LET NOT YOUR HEART BE TROUBLED. YE BELIEVE IN GOD, BELIEVE ALSO IN ME.  And, yielding his whole heart, and all his powers, to him who was calling for the sacrifice, he was made sensible of the reception of the  unspeakable gift.  He went to his work;  and oh,  said he,  everything was glorious around me--everything seemed  engaged  praising God!            The change which had come over the youth was conspicuous to all who knew him. He was diligent in attention to all his duties, but he had no inclination     
0      and the reason many were deceived was because they was not honest to themselves.            I think God has begun a good work in this part of his heritage, in which he has and continues to sow the seed of his kingdom; and while I am aware there is much that falls on the stony ground, I feel encouraged in the belief that there has some fallen on good ground, and I often pray God to prosper it, that it may bring forth fruit to his praise, and that the stony heart of man may be subdued. The Lord has lately been showing a small field of labor, which I believe it is his will that I should enter into, although the time it is to be accomplished, and the manner in which it is to be brought about, is yet hid from me; although, not long since, there came a delegation from the very place, inviting me to go and see them on a gospel mission. I told them that a mere call from man was not sufficient to set off on such a work; and I also told them that if the Lord had put it in their hearts to call me to their neighborhood, he would probably renew it, when one of them, a very humble-hearted Christian, said that he felt before leaving  home that it was the will of God. I then informed  them how I had felt about it, and I further told them that forty odd years had now passed away since the Lord first call me to this work; and when I excuse myself, saying,  I, poor slave,  and so on, he promise he help whenever I need him, and his promises are yea and amen forever; and at that time I did not know A from B, and I know but very little now, except what the Lord teach me, neither do I desire to, for God has said he will teach his people hisself, so that if a man lack wisdom he should ask it of God, and not of man, whose breath is in his nostrils,            very humble people at that time,) when I was awakened to a sense of my condition from these words, dropped from a humble minister:  The wicked have no hope beyond the grave, while the righteous have a hope beyond Jordan's cold stream; and after they have crossed Jordan they have gone home to a God of pity, to a God of compassion, to a God of sovereign mercy.  These words took a deep hold on my wicked heart, and break up the great deep in my soul. And this prepare me to seek such a friend. And after searching a long season of time, the Friend of Sinners appear and fill my heart with love. He give me peace of soul and confidence of mind; then I could gladly tell this glorious Savior's mine. This  destroyed all earthly fear, and prepare me to rest in hope. And  then I could say, by sea or land, by day or night:  The Lord is ever mine!  Forty odd years I travel on in this way, and it now appears more precious than the first. And now I say:                 Now, I would be glad for all the world to know that after I was awakened, as I have described, that love, in place of fear, fill my heart. May be I better say here that very often, when I goin' on in wickedness, something tell me this wicked, and I feel very bad. At that time I did not know that it was that good Spirit talking with me; yet I know all the time that I was doing wrong, 'cause I feel guilty, and that make me afraid. But when I give all up to serve the Lord, He promise He help whenever I need Him. And soon           after, He try my faith very strong.  My master who owned me at that time having no knowledge of God or godliness, supposed my religion was all a fancy, and said he could and would whip it out of me. He took me up and tie me, and scourged me until feeling of flesh was almost gone. At length I fall I before him and lift up my cries to heaven, and ask my great Creator  What have I done?   My master cursed me, and said:  Will you preach to me?  But I now feel glad that I could  suffer patiently for my new Master. And my manner at that time take master's strength away; and before he left me he untie me and let me off. But in about three hours he come again, and threaten me with fresh scourging. And though I was very weak from the beating I got, the Lord make me feel very strong, and this prepare me to answer:  You have whipped out all fear, and  I am not afraid of you no more.  You can take a gun and shoot me  or kill me, as you please, and all for nothing; and  that is all you can do: for I know I have a life you cannot  touch, and the fear of you will not keep me from doing  anything my new Master tells me to do. And if He let you take this poor bruised body of flesh, I feel it ain't worth much;    and I feel strength to say something like this:  Thy will, O God! be done, and not mine!  After this my old master was conquered, and never whip me again, and left me in the hands of Jehovah. This give me confidence to talk to the white or the black folks, and tell what the Lord had done for my poor soul. After this a great many come to me about religion, some good and some bad folks: for it was generally known that a great change had come over Tom. But I feel so poor, sometimes,  I have to wait             for the Spirit to warm my heart,  when I sometimes talk very free about the love of God, and then they listen   very attentively.  About this time the church requested  me to join them; but that I could not do without  my master's consent, (as it is against the laws of Virginia  for slaves to join without consent of their masters.) And when I ask him, he wrote these words:  That the church should judge for herself, for he was not a judge; but if they thought best to receive him he had no objections;  and for his part, he thought if there was a Christian in the world, Tom was one.  Upon this I join the church.            My master was an unbeliever, or tried hard to be, and he continue a wicked man to the last moment his life. He was quite intemperate. Before my master die he lost five children, two sons and three daughters; and when they were confined to their sick beds, he sometimes feel very tender, and would often recommend me to talk or pray with them, as I think best. A few days before my master die, I visited his bedside. I ask him how was the state of his mind. He answer:  Some say there is no hereafter.  I ask him what he say for hisseff. His answer, short and crabbed,  I don't know;  and these was the last words he ever spoke, and his countenance looked vicious when he dying.            But throughout a long life we lived together I often had to suffer a great deal that was wrong, or put up with it. Some time after I join the church, I sometimes feel that I would have to preach the gospel. This was a great trial to me, feeling I poor slave, and at that time did not know one letter. But one day, when alone, my Heavenly Father speak very plain to me:     
   war as well as was my master and mistress, it was agreed that I should leave Hayti on that account, and they provided for me a passage on board a vessel bound to New York, in order to educate me preparatory to going to my own people in Africa, to preach the Gospel of glad tidings of great joy to the ignorant and benighted of my fellow countrymen who are now believers in the false prophet Mahomed.           A book published at Utica, in the State of New York, and entitled  Facts for Baptist Churches,  by Mr. A. T. Foss, of New Hampshire, and E. Mathews, of Wisconsin, thus speaks of Mahommah:            After enduring the yoke for two years in Brazil, he escaped and sought a refuge in this land which boasts of its freedom and philanthropy, but that refuge he sought here in vain. Flying, therefore, from our shores, through a kind Providence, he was conducted to the city of Port au Prince, in Hayti, and to the christian hospitalities of Wm. L. Judd. Our missionary received him gladly, and while he provided him a home and temporal comforts, he failed not to instruct him in the religion of the Gospel. The instruction was to him as life from the dead, and his heart felt its power. He saw and acknowledged its adaptedness to his case as a sinner. He bowed to its authority. He rejoiced in its truth, and became a disciple of its Divine Author.           The baptismal scene, when Mahommah publicly put his trust in Christ, is thus described by Mr. Judd. It is taken from the  Christian Contributor.            His experience before the Church was was very affecting. Several persons present, not professors of religion, wept on hearing it. He is endowed by nature with a soul so noble that he grasps the whole world at a stroke, in the movements of his benevolent feelings, and the expression of such noble feelings in a style so simple and broken as his, is truly affecting. He now seems filled with the most ardent desire to labor for the salvation of souls--talks much of Africa, and prays ardently that her people may receive the Gospel--dreams often of visiting Kaskua, accompanied by 'a good white man,' as he calls a Missionary, and being kindly received by his mother. He had been asking       for baptism a considerable time, when I felt that I could not refuse him any longer. We repaired to the sea side very early in the morning, accompanied by a mixed congregation. After singing and praying in French, I delivered a discourse of perhaps twenty minutes, mostly extemporaneous, upon ( Les usages pratiques, de l'ordannance du Bapteme ) the practical usages of baptism, founded on Romans vi: 1-4. After this, I prayed in English for the especial benefit of Mahommah.           In passing down the gentle decent to reach a sufficient depth of water, I asked him if he wished now to devote himself entirely to God and to the good of the world. He replied, 'O yes, Mr. Judd,  I want to do all for God, all for good. ' In the water of the great deep, which in their eternal freedom rolling, bathe Africa as well as Hayti. I buried him with Christ in baptism, hoping that he may yet be borne upon its surface, as a messenger of mercy to the dark land of his birth.            I will give a slight glance at the voyage from Port au Prince to New York, and relate the incidents connected with it as briefly as possible. We had a most miserable passage, head winds nearly all the way; indeed, they continued from our leaving Hayti until reaching a southern port in the United States of America, into which we were compelled to run on account of the weather. The wife of Mr. Judd accompanied me on my voyage, she being on a visit to the States, where her parents resided.           When the vessel put into port a slave owner came aboard, and seeing me, asked if I was for sale, remarking I was a likely nigger, and would look well skinned, as my hide was a little too dark. We encountered at sea very heavy weather, the ship rocking and pitching most fearfully. We had prayers aboard, but we did not fear the raging of the sea, as our trust was in Him  who resteth the sea, and stilleth the tempest.  My mistress was very fond of me, and said she did not feel at all uneasy as long as Mahommah was near her. She had great confidence in me, not that I could have saved her in case of wreck, but I suppose she felt more at rest knowing me, and that I had been about her so long, and served her faithfully.           The weather, however, soon moderated, and we once more set    
      than the devil, for it is written in St. James,  Resist the devil, and he will flee from you;  but if you undertake to resist the slave-holder, he will hold you the tighter.             I knew a man who thought it too cruel to whip his slaves, but he stripped them naked, tied them to a board, (one end of which was on the fence, the other on the ground,) and then drew a cat by her tail down their backs. Of course the claws of the cat sunk deeply into the flesh, for at such a time a cat will resist this retrograde movement to the extent of her strength.  Then he would ask the poor slave if it hurt. The reply was,  Oh! pray, master, oh! pray, master, don't.              When in slavery I experienced a hope in Christ, from the 8th verse of the 23d chapter of Matthew,  *                 *I experienced a hope under a slave man.      Give us of your oil, for our lamps have gone out.  It was one year before I had evidence that my heart was changed.           This was in the year 1836. I was awakened by the Holy Spirit of God, by its divine influence operating on my mind, and the words,  Give me of your oil,  rang in my cars continually; but I strove hard against the spirit, to shake off these feelings, yet at the end of this year I was brought to submit to the will of God. I beheld myself a justly condemned sinner before God. I felt bound to give myself up to Him; and obtained a pardon for my sins--and to-day I am struggling to make my peace, my calling and election sure. The word of that poor unreleased slave has proved unto me the power and wisdom of God, and to-day I am trying to preach Christ to the inhabitants of Nantucket.

       Sukey Bat Moore on the Art of Flying.             One summer night about twelve o'clock my mother was awakened by Sukey (who had just  returned from a  revival ) kneeling at her bedside, saying,  Mistis, Mistis, pray for me,--Judy Freeman has got religion and I can't git it.  My mother tried to soothe, and promised to pray for  her. Later on she gave evidence of having  come through.  Not long afterward while in church she felt happy, and began to shout, saying,  Oh! I feel I can fly to heaven!  Some of the sisters said to her,  Aunt Sukey, do try,  and under the influence of excitement she really did jump out of the window, and of course fell to the ground; fortunately it was very low and she sustained no injury. One of her friends asked her why she failed to fly. She replied,  I dunno, honey, 'cept as how I didn't git de  right flop  !

              Having always, from parental training, purposed in my mind to become religious before I died, I thought that now was the time to begin to pray. But I could not try to pray in the church, for I was afraid that the girls would laugh at me. Yet I became so troubled, that I left the house, girls and all, intending to seek some place where I might pray. But to my horror and surprise, when I got out of the church, this reflection occurred to me,  God is in heaven, and you are on earth:--how can He hear you?  O, what distress of mind I now felt! I began to wonder how God could hear my prayer;. for, sure enough, He was in heaven, and I on the earth. In my perplexity, I started for home.             Just before I reached the shop, where I slept, this thought struck me, if possible with more force than the former reflection:  God does see you!  It really appeared to me as if I could see that God was indeed looking at me; and not only so, but I felt that He had been looking at me all my life. I now said to myself,  It is of no use for me to pray.-- If God has seen all my wickedness, as I feel that He has, then there is no mercy for me.              So I ran to my lodging-place, and tried to          hide myself in a dark room. But this was useless; for it appeared that God could see me in the dark, as well as in the light.             I now felt constrained to beg for mercy, and spent the time in trying to obtain pardon for my sins. But the morning came, and the hour drew near for the hands to go to work, and I was still unhappy.             I felt so very different to what I had always felt, that I tried to examine my impressions of the previous night, to learn if it was true that God did see me or not; for I thought my imagination might have deceived me.             Up to this time, I was not fully convinced that God knew all about me. So I began to study about the matter. As I sat on the shoe-bench, I picked up a bunch of bristles, and selecting one of the smallest, I began to wonder, if God could see an object so small as that. No sooner had this inquiry arose in my heart, than it appeared to me, that the Lord could not only see the bristle, but that He beheld me, as, plainly as I saw the little object in my hand; and not only so, but that God was then looking through me, just as I would hold up a tumbler of clear water to the sun and look through it. This was enough.          I felt that I must pray, or perish; and now I began to pray.             But it really seemed, that the more I prayed the less hope there was for me. Still I could not stop praying; for I felt that God was angry with me. I had sinned against his holy laws; and now, if He should cut me off, and send me to hell, it was but right. These thoughts followed me day and night, for five weeks, before I felt relief. At length, one day, while sitting on my shoe bench, I felt that my time had come when I must die. What troubled me most, was that I should have to appear before God, in all my sins;--O, what horror filled my soul at the thought!             I began to wonder what I must do. I knew I was not prepared for death and the Judgment. It is true that two of my shopmates, at that time, were members of the church; but they did not seem to care for my soul. All the rest of the hands were as wicked as myself.  What shall I do?  was in my mind, all the time I sat at work.             The reflection occurred to me,  Your mother is a christian; it may be she can save you.  But this suggestion appeared to be offensive to God. Then came another thought,-- As          my master was a rich man, could he not do something to help me?  But I found no relief in either . . . . and while I sat thus, hoping and praying, light broke into my mind--all my trouble left me in an instant.             I felt such a love and peace flowing in my soul, that I could not sit longer; I sprang to my feet, and cried out,  Glory to God!  It seemed to me, that God, whom I had beheld, a few seconds previously, angry with me, was now well-pleased. I could not tell why this great change had taken place in me; and my shopmates were surprised at my conduct, saying, that I must be getting crazy. But, just at this moment, the thought came into my mind, that I was converted; still, as I felt so very different from what I had expected to feel, I could not see how that could be. I concluded to run and see my mother, and ask her how people felt, when they got converted. So I went, right away, to my mother's house, some five or six squares from the shop.             When I reached the door of her house, it appeared to me that everything was new and bright. I went in, and sat down. Mother asked me how I was. I told her, I felt  right smart.  This was a new sound from me; for          my answers to this question had long been--   poorly.   But now came the trial; to ask mother how people felt, when they were converted. I felt ashamed to ask the question; so I went into another room; and seeing a hymn book lying on the table, I took it up. The first hymn that struck my sight began with these words:      When converts first begin to sing,        c.           These lines expressed my feelings precisely, and being encouraged from them, I went to my mother, and asked her the question--  How do people feel, when they get converted?  She replied,  Do you think you are converted?  Now, this was a severe trial; for, although I felt that I was really changed, yet I wanted to hear from her, before I could decide whether I was actually converted, or not. I replied,  No.  Then she said,  My son, the devil makes people think themselves converted, sometimes.  I arose, and          left immediately, believing that the devil had made a fool of me. I returned to my shop, more determined to pray than ever before.             I arrived, and took my seat, and tried to get under that same weight, that I had felt pressing me down, but a short while before. But it seemed to me that I could not; and, instead of feeling sad, I felt joyful in my heart; and while trying to pray, I thought the Saviour appeared to me. I thought I saw God smiling upon me, through Christ, His Son. My soul was filled with love to God and Jesus Christ. It appeared to me, I saw a fullness in Jesus Christ, to save every sinner who would come to Him. And I felt, that if I was only converted, I would tell all sinners how precious the Saviour was. But I could not think myself converted yet, because I could not see what I had done, for God to pardon my sins. Still I felt a love to Him for what He had done for my soul.             Then I began to think upon my shopmates --and, O what pity ran through my soul for them. I wished to pray for them; but I felt so unworthy, that I could not do it. At last I promised the Lord that if He would convert my soul, I would talk to them.                   * * It was several months after that, before I was made to realize this to be the work of God; and when it was made plain, O what joy it did bring to my poor soul!             I shortly became a member of the Baptist church, and was baptized, in company with some twenty others, by Rev. Geo. F. Adams, who was then pastor of the Baptist church in Fredericksburg--September 19,1831. This then contained about three hundred colored members.       
      overseer if I might go, but being positively denied, I concluded to go without his knowledge. When I reached home my mother was away. I set off and walked twenty miles before I found her. I staid with her for several days, and we returned together. Next day I was sent back to my new place, which renewed my sorrow. At parting, my mother told me that I had,  nobody in the wide world to look to but God.  These words fell upon my heart with  pondrous  weight, and seemed to add to my grief. I went back repeating as I went,  none but God in the wide world.  On reaching the farm, I found the overseer was displeased at me for going without  his liberty. He tied me with a rope, and gave me some stripes of which I carried the marks for weeks.             After this time, finding as my mother said, I had none in the world to look to but God, I betook  myself to prayer, and in every lonely place I found an altar. I mourned sore like a dove and chattered forth my sorrow, moaning in the corners of the field, and under the fences.             I continued in this state for about six months, feeling  as though my head were waters, and I could do nothing but weep. I lost my appetite, and not  being able to take enough food to sustain nature, I  became so weak I had but little strength to work; still I was required to do all my duty. One evening,            after the duties of the day were ended, I thought I could not live over the night, so threw myself on a bench, expecting to die, and without being prepared to meet my Maker; and my spirit cried within me, must I die in this state, and be banished from Thy presence forever? I own I am a sinner in Thy sight, and not fit to live where thou art. Still it was my fervent desire that the Lord would pardon me. Just at this season, I saw with my spiritual eye, an awful gulf of misery. As I thought I was about to plunge into it, I heard a voice saying,  rise up and pray,  which strengthened me. I fell on my knees and prayed the best I could the Lord's prayer. Knowing  no more to say, I halted, but continued on my knees. My spirit was then  taught  to pray,  Lord, have mercy on me--Christ save me.  Immediately there appeared a director, clothed in white raiment. I thought he took me by the hand and said,  come with me.  He led me down a long journey to a fiery gulf, and left me standing upon the brink of this awful pit. I began to scream for mercy, thinking I was about to be plunged to the belly of hell, and  believed I should sink to endless ruin. Although I prayed and wrestled with all my might, it seemed in vain. Still, I felt all the while that I was  sustained by some invisible power. At this solemn  moment, I thought I saw a hand from which hung, as it were, a silver hair, and a voice told me that all           the hope I had of being saved was no more than a  hair; still, pray, and it will be sufficient. I then  renewed my struggle, crying for mercy and salvation,  until I found that every cry raised me higher and  higher, and my head was quite above the fiery pillars.  Then I thought I was permitted to look straight  forward, and saw the Saviour standing with His hand  stretched out to receive me. An indescribably  glorious light was  in  Him, and He said,  peace, peace,  come unto me.  At this moment I felt that my sins  were forgiven me, and the time of my deliverance  was at hand. I sprang forward and fell at his feet,  giving Him all the thanks and highest praises, crying,  Thou hast redeemed me--Thou hast redeemed  me to thyself. I felt filled with light and love. At  this moment I thought my former guide took me  again by the hand and led me upward, till I came to  the celestial world and to heaven's door, which I saw  was open, and while I stood there, a power surrounded me which drew me in, and I saw millions  of glorified spirits in white robes. After I had this  view, I thought I heard a voice saying,  Art thou  willing to be saved?  I said, Yes Lord. Again I was  asked,  Art thou willing to be saved in my way?  I stood speechless until he asked me again,  Art  thou willing to be saved in my way?  Then I heard  a whispering voice say,  If thou art not saved in the  Lord's way, thou canst not be saved at all;  at which           I exclaimed,  Yes Lord, in thy own way.  Immediately  a light fell upon my head, and I was filled  with light, and I was shown the world lying in wickedness,  and was told I must go there, and call the  people to repentance, for the day of the Lord was at  hand; and this message was as a heavy yoke upon  me, so that I wept bitterly at the thought of what I  should have to pass through. While I wept, I heard  a voice say,  weep not, some will laugh at thee, some will scoff at thee, and the dogs will bark at  thee, but while thou doest my will, I will be with  thee to the ends of the earth. [ ]              I was at this time not yet thirteen years old. The  next day, when I had come to myself, I felt like a  new creature in Christ, and all my desire was to see  the Saviour.             I lived in a place where there was no preaching,  and no religious instruction; but every day I went out  amongst the hay-stacks, where the presence of the  Lord overshadowed me, and I was filled with sweetness  and joy, and was as a vessel filled with holy oil.  In this way I continued for about a year; many  times while my hands were at my work, my spirit  was carried away to spiritual things. One day as I  was going to my old place behind the hay-stacks to  pray, I was assailed with this language,  Are you  going there to weep and pray? what a fool! there  are older professors than you are, and they do not           take that way to get to heaven; people whose sins  are forgiven ought to be joyful and lively, and not  be struggling and praying.  With this I halted and  concluded I would not go, but do as other professors  did, and so went off to play; but at this moment  the light that was in me became darkened, and the  peace and joy that I once had, departed from me.             About this time I was moved back to the farm  where my mother lived, and then sold to a stranger.  Here I had deep sorrows and plungings, not having  experienced a return of that sweet evidence and  light with which I had been favoured formerly; but  by watching unto prayer, and wrestling mightily  with the Lord, my peace gradually returned, and  with it a great exercise and weight upon my heart  for the salvation of my fellow-creatures; and I was often carried to distant lands and shown places where  I should have to travel and deliver the Lord's message. Years afterwards, I found myself visiting  those towns and countries that I had seen in the  light as I sat it home at my sewing,--places of  which I had never heard.             Some years from this time I was sold to a  Presbyterian for a term of years, as he did not think it  right to hold slaves for life. Having served him  faithfully my time out, he gave me my liberty,  which was about the thirtieth year of my age.             As I now lived in a neighborhood where I could     
       ELIZABETH,   A COLORED MINISTER OF THE GOSPEL,  c.              *    I WAS born in Maryland in the year 1766. My parents were slaves. Both my father and mother were religious people,  and belonged to the Methodist Society. It was my father's practice to read in the Bible aloud to his children every sabbath morning. At these seasons, when I was but five years old, I often felt the overshadowing of the Lord's Spirit, without at all understanding what it meant; and these incomes and influences continued to attend me until I was eleven years old, particularly when I was alone, by which I was preserved from doing anything that I thought was wrong.               * In the following narrative of  Old Elizabeth,  which was taken mainly from her own lips in her ninety-seventh year, her simple language has been adhered to as strictly as was consistent with perspicuity and propriety.             In the eleventh year of my age, my master sent me to another farm several miles from my parents, brothers and sisters, which was a great trouble to me. At last I grew so lonely and sad I thought I should die, if I did not see my mother. I asked the overseer if I might go, but being positively denied, I concluded to go without his knowledge. When I reached home my mother was away. I set off and walked twenty miles before I found her. I staid with her for several days, and we returned together.

                I was quite a chunk of a boy afore I hearn much about 'ligion, afore I hearn much about dis glorious gospel.              Once in 'bout a year one o' dem clergy dat com'd ober de big water com'd round and preached up all de funerals ob de slaves dat died sen he com'd afore, and sometimes I feels very bad den. But after a bit dere com'd round one ob de big men from de college in de Jarseys,  *        * This it seems probable was the  eloquent President Davies.   and he telled us 'bout de matter werry solemn.   But I know nothing den about Jesus.  And now the tears began to trickle down the old man's cheeks.              An' den dar com'd along dat man dat died an' den com'd to life again, an' he telled de slaves 'bout Jesus. Oh, wat was he name? I don't mind now.  I suggested  William Tennent .  Oh, yes, massa!  Willie Tennent ! Glory to God! I been tryin to tink ob dat name dese many years. I knowed I should know him in glory, but now I will call him by name jus as soon as I sees him. After I heard him how I did feel! Wen I was walking on de ground it would keep sayin' ' Unworthy! unworthy! ' Wen I took a bit ob            bread, or a cup ob water, dey keep sayin' ' Unworthy! unworthy! ' Wen I goes into de field all de trees keep sayin' ' Unworthy! unworthy! ' Wen I goes into de yard I sees dat all de cattle kneels down afore dey lies down, an' I neber done dat. O massa, I thought I should die. I feels so bad.  (Then he would go on in various terms to tell of his utter despair.)  But bimbye dere com'd along a colored man who telled me des no use in my libin' dat way. He telled me ob de passage dat says: 'Behold de Lamb of God dat takes away de sins ob de world;' an' den I goes into de woods, an' all night I cries, 'O Lamb of God, hab mercy on dis poor man; [']  an' I cries an' prays dis ober an' ober; an', O massa! just as de light was coming ober de mountains ob ole Virginia de light of Jesus shined into dis poor soul, an' from dat day on, now about a hundred years, I've been tryin' to tell to saints and sinners round what a dear Saviour I have found.              He was ever magnifying the grace that rescued such a sinner as he, and that had sustained and comforted him in his long and weary pilgrimage. We have never known one whose soul would so soon melt and flow     
    master's, Mr. Oliver Sturges, who came from Fairfield, Connecticut. He bought me to drive his carriage. A new coachman's dress, which he gave me, would have felt much better, if it had not been for the large blister, that had been drawn upon my side. However, I rode down by my old master's, and cracked my whip with as much pride, spirit and activity, as one of Uncle Sam's Mail carriers, who drives four horses, on a general post road, drunk or sober. My old master happening to see me pass in this manner, was very much chagrined, to think he had sold me under the impression that I was just ready to die. He called his wife to the window, and complained to her, that she had urged him to sell me, and swore, and cursed outrageously. I was now under my sixth master, Mr. Sturges, who bought me from the Jew. Mr. Sturges, was a very kind master, but exceedingly severe when angry. He had a new negro, by the name of Cato, with whom I got a fighting, and bit off his nose, just as my master was going to sell him, which injured the sale of Cato, very much. For this I had to beg very hard to escape being whipped. I went to the fortune tellers, who told me that my master said, that if he should take me on with him to New York, I should be free: so I knew that I should not go with him. I had always been in the habit of praying, ever since I knew what it meant; and whenever I went to church, to drive the carriage, I used to stand upon the steps, and listen to the preaching. About this time, I began to realize that I was a sinner, and that hell would be my portion if I should die in my present situation: and afterwards while I was living with Doct. Collock, and under the advice of the Rev. Mr. Collock, whose voice and preaching, harrowed up my soul with awful apprehensions, I sought and obtained the hope of salvation. Blessed be God, I know the path to heaven. I have had sweet communion with the Lord; but alas! I have erred, and gone astray from holiness.            My conscience used sometimes to upbraid me with having done wrong, after I had run away from my master and arrived in Connecticut; and while I was living in Southington, Conn. (where I spent some time, as will afterwards be told) I went up on a high mountain, and prayed to the Lord, to teach me my duty, that I might know whether or not I ought to go back to my master. Before I came down I felt satisfied, and it did seem to me that the Lord heard my prayers, when I was a poor wretched slave, and delivered me out of the land of Egypt, and out of the      
    Sufficiency of food is a pretty important item in any man's account of life; but is tenfold more so in that of the slave, whose appetite is always stimulated by as much labor as he can perform, and whose mind is little occupied by thought on subjects of deeper interest. My post of superintendent gave me some advantages, too, of which I did not fail to avail myself, particularly with regard to those religious privileges, which, since I first heard of Christ and Christianity, had greatly occupied my mind. In Kentucky, the opportunities of attending on the preaching of whites, as well as of blacks, were more numerous; and partly by attending them, and the camp-meetings which occurred from time to time, and partly from studying carefully my own heart, and observing the developments of character around me, in all the stations of life which I could watch, I became better acquainted with those religious feelings which are deeply implanted in the breast of every human being, and learnt by practice how best to arouse them, and keep them excited, how to stir up the callous and indifferent, and in general to produce some good religious impressions on the ignorant and thoughtless community by which I was surrounded.            No great amount of theological knowledge is requisite for the purpose. If it had been, it is manifest enough that preaching never could have been my vocation; but I am persuaded that, speaking from the fulness of a heart deeply          impressed with its own sinfulness and imperfection, and with the mercy of God, in Christ Jesus, my humble ministrations have not been entirely useless to those who have had less opportunity than myself to reflect upon these all-important subjects. It is certain that I could not refrain from the endeavor to do what I saw others doing in this field; and I labored at once to improve myself and those about me in the cultivation of the harvests which ripen only in eternity. I cannot but derive some satisfaction, too, from the proofs I have had that my services have been acceptable to those to whom they have been rendered. In the course of the three years from 1825 to 1828, I availed myself of all the opportunities of improvement which occurred, and was admitted as a preacher by a Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church.            In the spring of the year 1828, news arrived from my master that he was unable to induce his wife to accompany him to Kentucky, and he must therefore remain where he was. He sent out an agent to sell all his slaves but me and my family, and to carry back the proceeds to him. And now another of those heart-rending scenes was to be witnessed, which had impressed itself so deeply on my childish soul. Husbands and wives, parents and children were to be separated forever. Affections, which are as strong in the African as in the European were to be cruelly disregarded; and the iron selfishness generated by the hateful  institution       
        CHAPTER IV.   MY CONVERSION.              A GOOD MAN.--HEAR A SERMON FOR THE FIRST TIME.--ITS EFFECT UPON ME.--PRAYER AND COMMUNION.--ITS FIRST FRUITS.               My heart exults with gratitude when I mention the name of a good man who first taught me the blessedness of religion. His name was John McKenny. He lived at Georgetown, a few miles only from Riley's plantation; his business was that of a baker, and his character was that of an upright, benevolent Christian. He was noted especially for his detestation of slavery, and his resolute avoidance of the employment of slave labor in his business. He would not even hire a slave, the price of whose toil must be paid to his master, but contented himself with the work of his own hands, and with           such free labor as he could procure. His reputation was high, not only for this almost singular abstinence from what no one about him thought wrong, but for his general probity and excellence. This man occasionally served as a minister of the Gospel, and preached in a neighborhood where preachers were somewhat rare at that period. One Sunday when he was to officiate in this way, at a place three or four miles distant, my mother urged me to ask master's permission to go and hear him. I had so often been beaten for making such a request that I refused to make it. She still persisted, telling me that I could never become a Christian if I minded beatings--that I must take up my cross and bear it. She was so grieved at my refusal that she wept. To gratify her I concluded to try the experiment, and accordingly went to my master and asked permission to attend the meeting. Although such permission was not given freely or often, yet his favor to me was shown for this once by allowing me to go, without much scolding, but not without a           pretty distinct intimation of what would befall me if I did not return immediately after the close of the service. I hurried off, pleased with the opportunity, but without any definite expectations of benefit or amusement; for up to this period of my life, and I was then eighteen years old, I had never heard a sermon, nor any discourse or conversation whatever, upon religious topics, except what I had heard from my mother, on the responsibility of all to a Supreme Being. When I arrived at the place of meeting, the services were so far advanced that the speaker was just beginning his discourse, from the text, Hebrews ii. 9:  That he, by the grace of God, should taste of death for every man.  This was the first text of the Bible to which I had ever listened, knowing it to be such. I have never forgotten it, and scarcely a day has passed since, in which I have not recalled it, and the sermon that was preached from it.             The divine character of Jesus Christ, his tender love for mankind, his forgiving spirit [,]  his compassion for the outcast and despised,           his cruel crucifixion and glorious ascension, were all depicted, and some of the points were dwelt on with great power; great, at least, to me, who then heard of these things for the first time in my life. Again and again did the preacher reiterate the words  for every man.  These glad tidings, this salvation, were not for the benefit of a select few only. They were for the slave as well as the master, the poor as well as the rich, for the persecuted, the distressed, the heavy-laden, the captive; for me among the rest, a poor, despised, abused creature, deemed of others fit for nothing but unrequited toil--but mental and bodily degradation. O, the blessedness and sweetness of feeling that I was LOVED! I would have died that moment, with joy, for the compassionate Saviour about whom I was hearing.  He loves me,   he looks down in compassion from heaven on me,   he died to save my soul,   he'll welcome me to the skies,  I kept repeating to myself. I was transported with delicious joy. I seemed to see a glorious being, in a cloud of splendor,           smiling down from on high. In sharp contrast with the experience of the contempt and brutality of my earthly master, I basked in the sunshine of the benignity of this divine being.  He'll be my dear refuge--he'll wipe away all tears from my eyes.   Now I can bear all things; nothing will seem hard after this.  I felt sorry that  Massa Riley  didn't know him, sorry he should live such a coarse, wicked, cruel life. Swallowed up in the beauty of the divine love, I loved my enemies, and prayed for them that did despitefully use and entreat me.             Revolving the things which I had heard in my mind as I went home, I became so excited that I turned aside from the road into the woods and prayed to God for light and for aid with an earnestness, which, however unenlightened, was at least sincere and heartfelt; and which the subsequent course of my life has led me to imagine was acceptable to Him who heareth prayer. At all events, I date my conversion, and my awakening to a new life--a consciousness of power and a destiny           superior to any thing I had before conceived of--rom this day, so memorable to me. I used every means and opportunity of inquiry into religious matters; and so deep was my conviction of their superior importance to every thing else, so clear my perception of my own faults, and so undoubting my observation of the darkness and sin that surrounded me, that I could not help talking much on these subjects with those about me; and it was not long before I began to pray with them, and exhort them, and to impart to the poor slaves those little glimmerings of light from another world, which had reached my own eye. In a few years I became quite an esteemed preacher among them, and I will not believe it is vanity which leads me to think I was useful to some.             I must return, however, for the present, to the course of my life in secular affairs, the facts of which it is my principal object to relate.      
     to meet again, and little children torn from their parents' loving arms, and sold into slavery, and into the hands of strangers from distant parts. Here is a pictorial illustration of the slaves being sold at a public auction--           Slaves being sold at Public Auction.  This cut appeared in the book called  Uncle Tom's Cabin,  and now used by permission of  The Christian Age.       RELIGIOUS AWAKENING.             In the midst of all their sufferings, the slaves would sing many of the religious songs that were sung by Jubilee Singers. And I often joined in the singing, When I resolved to  seek religion,  I was then nearly sixteen years          of age. My master was a member of the Episcopalian Church, and would teach me to say my prayers, and the Apostles' Creed, and read to me about Abraham's servants and Isaac's servants, and Jacob's servants, and  servants, obey your masters.  He would read these  wise  precepts over to me so carefully, have prayers, and then, when he felt like it (which he often did), gave me a lashing. And whenever he thought I ought to have a flogging, he would say to me:  Report yourself to me to-morrow morning after breakfast.  If I did not report to get my flogging, I would have an extra lashing for that. Yet, with all this, my lot was much better than many of those around me. There was a man who owned the next plantation whose name was Jackson. He was so cruel to the slaves that he was known to them as  the devil.  I remember well how I used to think of  seeking religion,  but whenever I began to think seriously on this matter, a great obstacle confronted me. I was superstitious. Superstition is characteristic of the race in Africa. Having been brought to America, not permitted to be taught to read the Bible, and having every avenue to education closed against us, it was natural we should retain the superstitions of our fathers. My idea was that if I set out to  seek religion,  I must meet with that old serpent, the devil. I often heard slaves say that when they set out to  seek religion,  the devil set out with them, and this greatly perplexed me. Then I heard them talk of seeing ghosts. But after they were converted they would go six and ten miles at night to a meeting, and God would be with them. I resolved to set out definitely to get religion, with all my strange thoughts and fears. I thought the worst sin a man could be guilty of was murder. I knew I was innocent of that. One day, I was out gathering blackberries, and commenced to pray the Lord's Prayer; I knew not what else to say. As I prayed, a rabbit jumped up from under the bush from which I was gathering the berries. I felt sure          this was the devil. I had heard that when he deceived Eve in the garden, he came like a serpent; and, furthermore, he could put himself into any shape. I was never more frightened in all my life. I was afraid to say my prayers at night, not so much because I might disturb the devil, but because he might disturb me. I wept bitterly in my loneliness and in my darkness of mind, having no father or mother to direct me.      SOLD TO ANOTHER MASTER.             About the year 1852 my master took to himself a wife, and then I was sold to his brother, who lived in Richmond, Virginia. Here I again met my dear mother, after having been separated from her for about six years. This brother had always been kind to slaves, and every member of the family followed his example. How much he paid for me I never heard. His son once told me that he had been offered three thousand dollars in gold for me, but that he would not accept the amount. From this time I received better treatment. I was never flogged after coming into his hands. I was told that I was to be the property of his eldest son. He was much younger than myself. Now, during all this time I never lost sight of the lessons my dear mother had taught me, and while I was separated from her I worked hard in order to be able to make the letters of the Alphabet, and had learned to spell a large number of words. But I found out that the white people did not use the large letters of the Alphabet as I did when writing. I was strongly of the impression that an education consisted in knowing how to write, and I also knew that the slave-owners were opposed to their slaves acquiring even the most elementary literary knowledge. There was a slave on our lot named Anthony Burnes, who managed to get to Boston. Under the fugitive slave law he was brought back to Richmond, Virginia,     
       LIFE OF  FRIDAY JONES.            My first remembrance of my life begins when I was from 8 to 10 years of age. I was born in North Carolina in 1810, the property of Olser Hye, within 15 miles of the capital of the State-- Raleigh. My mother's name was Cherry and my father's, Barney. I was taken away from them when I was small and hired out to Sim Alfred, who lived about two miles from where I was born. My mother was traded for a tract of land and sent to Alabama. My father died about this time. Just at this time I was brought to know right from wrong. I was afraid to plough in the corn-field by myself--always used to working with a large force of hands before that. I promised then and there that if I lived to be a man I would get religion. It occurred to me that if I had religion I would not be afraid of dying. When I was a boy, whichever way I turned it looked as though something was going to catch me. Though I was but a small boy I promised that I would not live the life my father had lived. I knew my father was a desperate wicked man, would get drunk. His associates were all wicked. My poor dear mother, I could not say anything about her religion but she taught me how to pray before she left me. The morning she left I could not bear to shake her hand and bid her good bye. I heard from her. She was the mother of eleven [11] children. She left four little ones of us. I was the oldest one of the four, being only about 10 years of age myself, father dead, and mother gone to the State of Alabama. It has  been over 60 years since she left us, and I have never forgotten my  mother; have no remembrance of ever having heard from her since. I promised God I would seek my soul's salvation when I got to be a man, and often refreshed my memory that I had promised Him never to live the life of my father. My conscience spoke to me and said I  thought you promised never to live the life of your father. You are  living the very same life he lived. It startled me and I looked up and cast my eyes towards the Heaven. I had to go out and fall on my face, and prayed to Almighty God. He held me to my promises and pledge until I was a man. You see at once reader how awful it is to sin against God. I was a poor ignorant boy. God had  enlitghtened  me at that day and supported me down to this day. Young man, young woman, if you have a wicked mother or a wicked father do not pursue the course that they do. Better young men to let your father go down to destruction than for you both to go.           Better young woman to let your mother go down to destruction than to let you both go. Young man if the Lord plants the seed of grace in your heart save your father through prayer if possible. Better young woman if the Lord plants the seed of grace in your heart to try and save your mother through the power of your prayers. The Lord made impression on my heart and has since completed the confession in my soul. During the dark times of slavery, ignorant as I was, He called me, and I have believed on Him ever since. No young man or woman has any excuse for sinning against God. If God enlightened me at that day and time what ought you to do with all the advantages you have now. God requires all at your hands.             He requires you to seek Him early while He may be found. That was His language to me sixty years ago. Every young man and boy, God has His eye fixed on you and is warning you every day. Every young woman and girl, God has his eye fixed on you warning you every day. Little boys and girls, God has His eye on you. He is bringing warning to your ears. He intends that none of you shall die with any excuse for not seeking Him. The first text I ever remember in my life was about the rich man and Lazarus. When I was a boy I didn't know a text. God put it in my heart to believe that text. The first minister I ever knew belonged to the Baptist denomination, (colored) his name was Stephen Southerlin. The next was a white minister belonging to the Methodist denomination by the name of David Fowler. Over 60 years since I heard them preach, and they were the first I ever heard. God put it in my heart to believe the Gospel. His spirit has forever found me. Second text was :  It shall be well with the righteous, for they shall receive the works of their hands.  The next text was:  They that have pity on the poor lendeth to the Lord.  In my fancy God had me to believe in this. I say to you young men and young women He is speaking to you as He spoke to me. God lets no man live or die with any excuse. Not knowing his will, he teaches us, through our forefathers' sins, that we are guilty rebels in His sight. I was taught that John said prepare Ye, for the kingdom of God is at hand. If God taught us in that day and time, how much more does he teach you now, that I did not know.             If He held me responsible then,  dose  He not hold you so to-day? He is a just God, He deals with all his people alike. He that will come shall come. He has made rich promises for us all. Taught me from a small boy. He is teaching me to day. I ask you young people to remember one thing, do not follow your wicked parents;  act, act  wise. Go to the Lord while you are young; while you may, as when I came to be a man grown, I was not ready then. I made many attempts to bow and pray to God, but failed to be in earnest. His spirit followed so long I had to give up my work and bow and pray. On one occasion I went out and tried to pray to God and raised up and felt worse than I did before. I bowed down, the Lord spoke to me and said, never can you obtain religion while you continue drinking whiskey. This was in 1851. I then ceased to drink, the devil got with me, told me it was all imagination and that I could take whiskey moderately two or three times a day and seek my salvation too. I did not know it was He at that time, but I yielded to           Him. I turned to and drank again as usual. In 1853 I was living in the little town of Lamberton, Robertson Co., N.C., near the line of South Carolina, when the greatest revival broke out that I had ever seen, at a Methodist quarterly meeting, during the months of June and July. The people were going up and confessing their religion by scores [.]  God's spirit had been following me until that meeting. I thought at that revival I would seek my soul's salvation. At the revival, Peter Doubt, from Raleigh, preached a sermon. So Martin, of Franklin, preached a sermon. He had formerly been a circuit rider, and was now stationed in Lamberton, they said ruin this revival and the year 1853 will roll some of you into eternity. You may never have another opportunity. Ones' text  Bring my  sipirit  away from Ephriham for he is joined to his idols again.  Ones' text was,  Go your way, Saul,  says Felix,  and come at a more convenient season and I will hear thee,  and during that revival I felt that I was a lost man. I had been so; I felt like this before. But at this revival I could not feel. I attempted to pray, but could'nt pray. I sat then and found out it was all for nothing, it seemed to me the whole of the subject seemed for me. I was the guilty man. The whole of the argument was that God never let His spirit go back to Ephriham again, but left him there and gave him up to be lost and damned forever. Felix never saw Paul again to talk with him, and that was me; both cases seemed to suit me exactly.             On one occasion during the revival I stood up and shed tears like a child; I felt my sins and asked God to forgive me and I would never sin any more--I thought I was a lost man. I went or for weeks, crying and howling to God, going on that I was a lost man. This was in 1853. I attempted to pray and could not. I would up and go, lie down by a place, get up and try it again; no relief for me yet. I would go out during the dark hours of the night, away in a lonesome place to pray. I asked God if he had drawn His spirit away from me and left me to be damned, to show it to me. He manifested that He had not drawn His Holy Spirit from me. You could hear me cry aloud, I was so rejoiced that I could be saved.             In 1854 I professed religion at my work in the woods. I forget the day of the month. In November, 1855, I was baptized ; many sore trials from June 1853 to 1855. They attempted to whip me in 1854 and backed me down but I continued to pray night and day. A  company of men hired me that year--gave Dr. Rogers $300 for me a year. When they did this, I looked at them wistfully, and when they talked of whipping me, I told them to back me down and get their shooting works ready and kill or cripple me and pay for me, for I did not let Dr. Rogers whip me and would not let anyone else do it. I went home to him on or about, the 4th of July, and told him I wanted to leave and must leave. He said that it was a good note, and for me to and stay the year out, as he did not want to take his note in. I answered him and said if he did not want to take his note in I was man enough to take care of myself.             I went back a few days after the 4th of July, but before this time I had professed a hope. I do this to show to men that no devil has the power to keep a man from praying if he is in earnest. In     
      the store. When he came into the store that morning, two of his neighbors, Julius Dumbiven, and MacCauslin, came in too. He called me up, and asked me again where I  staid  last night. I told him with his boy, Joseph. He said he knew that was a lie; and he immediately sent off for Joseph to confirm his suspicions. He ordered me to strip off my clothes, and, as I did so, he took down the cow hide heavy and stiff with blood which he had before drawn from my body with that cruel weapon, and which was congealed upon it. Dumbiven professed to be a Christian, and he now came forward and earnestly interceded for me, but to no purpose, and then he left. McCauslin asked my master, if he did not know, that a slave was worth more money after he became pious than he was before. And why then, he said, should you forbid Tom going to meetings and praying? He replied, that religion was all a damned mockery, and he was not going to have any of his slaves praying and whining round about their souls. McCauslin then left. Joseph came and told the same story about the night before that I had done, and then began to beg master not to whip me. He cursed him and drove him off. He then whipped me with great severity, inflicting terrible pain at every blow upon my quivering body which was still very tender from recent lacerations. My suffering was so great, that it seemed to me that I should die. He paused at length, and asked me would I mind him and stop praying. I told him I could not promise him not to pray any more, for I felt that I must and should pray as long as I lived.  Well, then, Tom,  he said,  I swear that I will whip you to death.  I told him I could not help myself, if he was determined to kill me, but that I must pray while I lived. He then began to whip me the second time, but soon stopped, threw down the bloody cow-hide, and told me to go wash myself in the river, just back of the store, and then dress myself, and if I was determined to be a fool, why I must be one. My mistress now interceded earnestly for me with my cruel master. The next Sabbath was love feast, and I felt very anxious to join in that feast. This I could not do without a paper from my master, and so I asked mistress to help me. She advised me to be patient, and said she would help me all she could. Master refused to give any paper, and so I could not join the loving feast the next day.             On the next Friday evening, I went to the prayer meeting. Jack Cammon was there, and opened the meeting with prayer. Then Binney Pennison gave out the sweet hymn, which begins in these words:      Come ye sinners poor and needy,               I felt that it all applied most sweetly to my condition, and I said in my heart, I will come now to Jesus, and trust in him. So when those who felt anxious were requested to come forward and kneel within the altar for prayer, I came and knelt down. While Jacob Cammon was praying for me, and for those who knelt by my side, my burden of sorrow, which had so long weighed me down, was removed. I felt the glory of God's love warming my heart, and making me very happy, I shouted aloud for joy, and tried to tell all my poor slave brothers and sisters, who were in the house, what a dear Saviour I had found, and how happy I felt in his precious love. Binney Pennison asked me if I could forgive my master. I told him I could, and did, and that I could pray God to forgive him, too, and make him a good man. He asked me if I could tell my master of the change in my feelings. I told him I should tell him in the morning.  And what,  he asked,  will you do if he whips you still for praying and going to meeting ?  I said I will ask Jesus to help me bear the pain, and to forgive my master for being so wicked. He then said,   Well, then, Brother Jones, I believe that you are a Christian.              A good many of us went from the meeting to a brother's cabin, where we began to express our joy in happy songs. The palace of General Dudley was only a little way off, and he soon sent over a slave with orders to stop our noise, or he would send the patrolers upon us. We then stopped our singing, and spent the remainder of the night in talking, rejoicing, and praying. It was a night of very great happiness to me. The contrast between my feelings then, and for many weeks previous, was very great. Now all was bright and joyous in my relations towards my precious Saviour. I felt certain that Jesus was my Saviour, and in this blessed assurance, a flood of glory and joy filled my happy soul. But this sweet night passed away, and, as the morning came, I felt that I must go home, and bear the slave's heavy cross. I went and told my mistress the blessed change in my feelings. She promised me what aid she could give with my master, and enjoined upon me to be patient and very faithful to his interest, and, in this way, I should at length wear out his  opposiition  to my praying and going to meeting.             I went down to the store in a very happy state of mind. I told James my feelings.  He called me a fool, and said master would be sure to whip me. I told him I hoped I should be able to bear it, and to forgive master for his cruelty to me. Master came down, talked with me a while, and told me that he should whip me because I had disobeyed him in staying out all night. He had told me he should whip me if ever I did so, and he     
  praying. I told him I could not promise him not to  pray any more, for I felt that I must and should pray  as long as I lived.  Well, then, Tom,  he said,  I  swear that I will whip you to death.  I told him I  could not help myself, if he was determined to kill me,  but that  I must pray while I lived.  He then began to  whip me the second time, but soon stopped, threw down  the bloody cowhide, and told me to go wash myself in  the river, just back of the store, and then dress myself,  and if I was determined to be a fool, why, I must be  one. My mistress now interceded earnestly for me  with my cruel master. The next Sabbath was love  feast, and I felt very anxious to join in that feast. This  I could not do without a paper from my master, and so  I asked mistress to help me. She advised me to be  patient, and said she would help me all she could.  Master refused to give any paper, and so I could not  join in the love feast the next day.          On the next Friday evening, I went to the prayer  meeting. Jack Cammon was there, and opened the  meeting with prayer. Then Binney Pennison gave  out the sweet hymn, which begins in these words:    Come ye sinners, poor and needy,  Weak and wounded, sick and sore.             I felt that it all  applied most sweetly to my condition,  and I said in my heart,  I  will come  now  to Jesus, and   trust  in him. So when those who felt anxious were  requested to come forward and kneel within the altar  for prayer,  I  came and knelt down. While Jacob  Cammon was praying for me, and for those who knelt  by my side, my burden of sorrow, which had so long  weighed me down, was removed. I felt the glory of  God's love warming my heart, and making me very  happy. I shouted aloud for joy, and tried to tell all  my poor slave brothers and sisters, who were in the  house, what a dear Saviour I had found, and how happy  I felt in his precious love. Binney Pennison asked me  if I could forgive my master. I told him I could, and           did, and that I could pray God to forgive him, too, and  make him a good man. He asked me if I could tell  my master of the change in my feelings. I told him I  should  tell him in the morning.  And what,  he said    will you do if he whips you still for praying and  going to meeting?  I said I will ask Jesus to help  me to bear the pain, and to forgive my master for being  so wicked. He then said,  Well, then, Brother  Jones, I believe that you are a Christian.           A good many of us went from the meeting to a  brother's cabin, where we began to express our joy in  happy songs. The palace of General Dudley was only  a little way off, and he soon sent over a slave with  orders to stop our noise, or he would send the patrolers  upon us. We then stopped our singing and spent the  remainder of the night in talking, rejoicing and praying.  It was a night of very great happiness to me.  The contrast between my feelings then, and for many  weeks previous, was very great. Now, all was bright  and joyous in my relations towards my precious Saviour.  I felt certain that Jesus was my Saviour, and in this  blessed assurance a flood of glory and joy filled my  happy soul. But this sweet night passed away, and,  as the morning came, I felt that I must go home, and  bear the  slave's heavy  cross. I went, and told my mistress  the blessed change in my feelings. She promised  me what aid she could give me with my master, and  enjoined upon me to be patient and very faithful to his  interest, and, in this way, I should at length wear out  his opposition to my praying and going to meeting.          I went down to the store in a very happy state of  mind. I told James my feelings. He called me a  fool, and said master would be sure to whip me. I  told him I hoped I should be able to bear it, and to forgive  master for his cruelty to me. Master came down,  talked with me a while, and told me he should whip me  because I had disobeyed him in staying out all night.  He had told me he should whip me if ever I did so, and  he should make every promise good. So I began to  take off my clothes. He called me a crazy fool, and       
   meeting, and heard them all telling the experience of grace. I was then quite small. They talked about how good the Lord had been to them. I sat and listened. I cried and wondered why I could not talk that way too. I could not understand it. I had peculiar ideas as to what religion was. The Rev. R. Bain came over to our house one morning to see my father. he said to him,  Andy, I believe in my soul I've got religion.  My father replied, but I have forgotten his answer. I went off wondering what he meant. My thoughts ran high; I thought that if he had religion he at least ought to know it; yet I hadn't the remotest idea what he meant. Yet I thought it was something very solemn, for he was crying. When he said that he believed that he had religion, I thought it was something written on a piece of paper, hence he ought to know it, yet the thought came back to me as to the cause of his crying. This thought haunted me. In going after my cows I would ask myself the question,  What did he mean?  My mind grew more active, but the mystery I could not comprehend. I had great faith in my father, and I thought he could whip a world, yet I saw him crying. Father said to Rev. Bain,  God is good; He saved me from hell.  Hark! I began to fear though only eleven years old. A thought came to me to seek that which had been found by my father.  Seek and ye shall find,  I had heard Bro. Bain remark,       but how and in what way should I seek, and hopes I had none as to the consummation of my desires. My head was bowed down in sorrow. They watched me at home, and one would ask the other,  What is the matter with Elijah?  They could not tell. I hardly knew what was the matter with myself. Nature had taught me that I was a sinner. I wanted some instruction what to do. I was ignorant. I had heard many a prayer from mother and father and old Brother Bullitt, but none of them gave me any promise.           Instruction, teaching, was what I most needed. One day I was sent out into the field to cut corn-stalks with one of my young masters. He looked at me, and he saw that I was sin sick. He, being a Christian, took me in hand and told me that I was a sinner, and that Jesus Christ died to save sinners, and all I had to do was to believe that Jesus Christ was able to save. He told me about hell and its horrors. From morning to evening he talked. I prayed the best I could after I left him. I prayed during that week, and had a special place to pray every morning, when I went after the cows, about a mile from home, under a June apple-tree. Sunday came and I went to church and heard old Brother James Venable preach from this text,  Escape for your life.  I was struck with conviction, and lingered along until Rev. Charles Wells, who was then pastor of the Colored Baptist Church, Simpsonville,        commenced a protracted meeting. Shortly after the commencement of the meeting I professed faith in Christ. Oh how well I remember the time when Jesus freed me! Then, after I had found Christ, I had to go to Old Mass and Old Miss to get permission to join the Church. They consented, and then came the time to be baptized. It was extremely cold, and the streams covered with ice an inch thick. I had to again ask permission to be baptized, and with tears in their eyes my request was granted. Rev. Wells buried about fifty souls that day in the liquid grave. Thank God that I was saved!           There was something on Robinson place that was an exception to the general rule. There were forty-two in family, and all members of the Church who were above ten years of age, and all Baptists save one old colored lady, Robinson himself having been a deacon in the Baptist Church for about forty years. After my conversion and baptism I was permitted to attend Sunday-school and study the Word of God for myself. My master then removed all objections to my learning how to read, and said he wanted all the boys to learn how to read the Bible, it being against the laws of the State to write. We had to steal that portion of our education, and I did my share of it I suppose. Only a few of the white people would let their slaves attend the Sunday-school, hence I became an active member in it.     
   CHAPTER  III.    HER COMMISSION.            In those days there were no churches for the slaves on the   plantation, but they were compelled to go from one plantation   to another to hold their meetings in their log cabins. She   used to go with her aunt and others to those prayer meetings.   The mighty power of God would be in the meetings. They   would hold their meetings sometimes nearly all night. Many   would fall under the mighty power of God, and many of them  would get soundly converted.          Our subject was greatly urged to seek the Lord. She went   forward and soon found that she was a lost sinner without the   blood of Jesus to wash away all her sins.           They would  work hard all day in the corn fields and nearly  every night would go two or three miles from home to attend   meeting. Many were converted every night. She was somewhat  discouraged because she was so slow to believe. Her   cousin fell under the mighty power of God, and was happily  converted, coming through shouting and praising God, and   commenced at once to preach to the people, telling them to flee   from the wrath to come. She said to our subject to believe   and she would be converted. This encouraged her to go on.   	     She was trying to get converted shouting, like her cousin, but   the Dear Lord did not come to her in that way. She did reason  with the devil for some time, who told her that if she did   not shout she would not have religion. She had a terrible   struggle to get over that. After that terrible struggle about   getting converted shouting, her faith was greatly increased, and  while she was praying one day she was wonderfully blessed.   She told her cousin how she felt. Her cousin told her that she   had religion. She said,  Oh, no, I am just getting in a good   way.  She did not understand the scheme of the devil, so she   was defeated and had to do her work all over again . But the   Holy Spirit still strove with her. The meetings were still going  on with increased power. She attended nearly ever night.   The old people encouraged her, and then she began to take part   in speaking and praying. By so doing the same blessing came   to her again, but she was not satisfied. She went on in that   state quite a long time. Finally one night she went to bed and   fell into a dream, or trance, she did not know which. However  a man came to her while she was in that vision. She was   trying to cross a clear stream of water. The man she believed   to be a white man. He threw a narrow board in the middle of   the stream of water, and there was also a broad board in the   stream. The man told her to make her choice. She stepped   on the narrow one and went across. As soon as she was across   he showed her a beautiful place and told her it was heaven.   She saw her cousin there and she was with all the angels. They   were all just alike. She turned to come back, when she heard   a voice saying:  You have just as much religion as those who   shout. After that she woke up. She felt very strange and   told her aunt about the vision. Her aunt said that she would         get through all right. In a short time afterwards she received   the witness of the Holy Spirit that her sins were all forgiven.   She was then a happy girl. She knew that her sins were all   washed away by the blood of Jesus. She could sing this song:                                          Oh! happy day, that fixed my choice,                                       On Thee, my Savior and my God;                                         Well may this glowing heart rejoice,                                      And tell its rapture all abroad.                                         Happy day! Happy day!                                       When Jesus washed my sins away.                                       He taught me how to watch and pray,                                      And live rejoicing every day,                                       Happy day! Happy day!                                       When Jesus washed my sins away.            The meeting spread  from one plantation to another, and   many of the poor slaves' hearts were made to rejoice, for the   Lord Jesus visited them, notwithstanding they were treated   only as cattle and horses. Thanks be unto the Lord God of   Heaven, who did look down upon them in their helpless condition  in tender mercy.           The subject of this sketch was a faithful young Christian,   laboring in the prayer meetings from house to house. They did   not have churches of their own. She related that one night   their prayer meeting continued until daylight, the power of   God having fallen upon the people in such a wonderful manner   that they fell on the floor like dead men and women. Many   of them had to go one, two and three miles to their homes, and   some of them were greatly punished for being away from their   houses at that late hour of night, for most all of them were,          compelled to go to work before daylight. But in spite of all   this cruel treatment they would pray and sing so that it would   disturb their old masters so that they could not sleep and they   would whip them, but still the poor slaves would continue to   serve the Lord.          Our subject said that one of the masters in that part of   Kentucky, a cruel slave holder whose name we can not recall,   had a slave (a man) by  the name of Dick, who was a true man   of God. His master was so bitterly opposed to his serving the   Lord as not to even permit him to return thanks at the table   before taking his meals. But Dick had settled the matter, and   the more his master would punish him the more he would pray   for his master.  At length his prevailing prayer with his God   was the salvation of his master, and he was converted in a   wonderful manner at a camp meeting.  Dick was present, and   his master ran to him, threw his arms around him and took   him up and carried him around in the camp ground. After his    conversion he set Dick free, and, giving him a horse, saddle   and bridle, told  him to go and preach the gospel everywhere.   He also set free all the rest of  his slaves. Oh, it is wonderful how God can use a man. This is true        
    BIOGRAPHY,  C.           LONDON FERRILL is now commencing the sixty-fifth year of his age, and was born on the forks of Hanover, just opposite the birth place of the Hon. HENRY CLAY. He was owned by Mrs. Ann Winston, his mother belonging to that lady's brother, Richard Ferrill, who came from England, and shortly after his arrival, died and left all of his estate to his sister, Mrs. Ann Winston. His mistress named him London Ferrill, after her brother, and at her death, her large estate was divided among her children, when he was sold for six hundred dollars to Col. Samuel Overton, a bachelor, thus separated from his mother at eight or nine years of age, but the kindness of his owner buoyed him up, and childlike, he felt but little the want of a kind mother.           At the age of eleven, quite a romantic little incident occurred, while Ferrill Price and our hero were bathing in the river, by which they were both thrown into the water, clenched together, and but for the timely assistance of a washerwoman they would both have met watery graves. They had sunk twice when the woman espying them, rushed into the water, supporting herself by the limb of a tree, caught one of them by the hair of the head, and thus drew them ashore, where reclining their heads down the sloping bank, the water had an opportunity to escape, and thus, in a few minutes, they were restored to  conciousness.  After recovering, he was severely punished and strict orders given him to keep away from the river. A few days after this occurrence, the two met and had some conversation in regard to their fate, had they been drowned, and both were of opinion that they would have gone to the  lake of fire and brimstone,  and they covenanted together, that henceforward they would serve their God alone. The escape from death       had an important influence on then conduct in after life.           After this, he was bound to Edmund Daily to learn the House joinery business, and during his apprenticeship, he felt that his sins were pardoned--that God loved him and would keep him from temptation. He then wished to ascertain how far the other party to the covenant had persevered in his religious career, but, alas for human nature, he had forgotten his promise, and yet remained a sinner out of the fold of God, and when Ferrill talked to him on the subject, tears coursed down his checks, and but a few weeks elapsed before he and his wife were buried with Christ in Baptism. He sent for him to witness the ceremony, and at the same time Ferrill related his religious experience to Rev. Absalom Waller, and was himself baptised which important event occurred when he was twenty years of age. After his baptism he felt himself called to preach the Gospel but was disobedient to the Heavenly Order. Shortly after this he attended a prayer meeting, where the new converts, Elders and members were assembled. After singing and praying for some time, he was called on to sing. With many misgivings and a palpitating heart he rose, requested an Elder if he should make a mistake to correct him and proceeded to sing,  Alas, and did my Savior bleed, and did my sovereign die.            After singing, he was called on to pray, and the first thing he knew after kneeling down, he was standing up, relating his religious experience, and felt the love of God shed abroad in his heart as much as when he was first converted. He heard no sound, but in his soul he felt, that the command bound him to go and preach the gospel to every creature, and he said,  Thy will be done.  The whole house was one sea of commotion, and all seemed rejoicing in the Lord, shaking hands and evincing by their every look, the presence of the Spirit of Grace shed abroad in their hearts. He attended two more meetings of a similar character, and, at the last one, he hid himself away in the corner, as he had some suspicion that they wished to exalt him to some position, which perhaps he could not fill with       honor to himself, and what was and is far more  imimportant  with honor to his God. When all the others had finished singing and praying, an enquiry was made if he was in the house, when he was brought out from his place of concealment and told to sing, pray, exhort, or preach, or whatever the Spirit of the Lord prompted him to do, and this Scripture came into his mind:  I can do all things, the Lord helping me.  He spoke from these words about twenty-five minutes, then the meeting was dismissed. They told him to remain after the congregation had retired. They placed a chair and he sat down in it, and they propounded various questions, which were answered satisfactorily. They then put their hands on his head and prayed God's blessing up on him in all after life. After this they arose from their knees and gave him the right hand of fellowship, and said  we give you up to go and preach the gospel wherever the Lord may cast your lot and the doors open for you.            He commenced preaching, and the people appeared to receive the word gladly, and when he had gained about fifty converts who were ready to be baptised which ceremony he was not authorised to perform by the Virginia law, he procured the services of Preacher Bowles, and he baptised them. The white people frequently invited Ferrill to their houses to sing for them, as he was considered a great singer, and was sent for, far and near, to preach funeral sermons when the servants would die. On one occasion he went twenty-four miles to Bears Island to preach a funeral sermon. The servants met him at the gate and warned him not to go in, as the overseer, Neill Barnett, had threatened to beat him if he preached on his premises.           The prospect was not very flattering and he even faltered, but thinking of what the Apostles had suffered, he concluded to proceed, let the consequences be what they might. After singing and and praying, he looked out and saw the overseer with two other men, coming toward him, all three armed with clubs and cow hides. The reader may fancy his feelings at this time, and he assures us, that they were of a most unpleasant character. However he commenced his discourse from    
    and some were kept on the plantation, where they remain, the victims of cruel slavery. Such bad reports were made respecting the free States, that they were afraid to come here, even to be free.       MY OWN HISTORY.              HAVING briefly given the history of the overseers, I will now give my own, and how I, a slave, learned to read and write. Edloe owned eighty-one slaves, and among them all, only myself could either read or write. When I was a child, my mother used to tell me to look to Jesus, and that he who protected the widow and fatherless would take care of me also. At that time, my ideas of Jesus were the same as those of the other slaves. I thought he would talk with me, if I wished it, and give me what I asked for. Being very sickly, my greatest wish was to live with Christ in heaven, and so I used to go into the woods and lie upon my back, and pray that he would come and take me to himself,--really expecting to see Him with my bodily eyes. I was then between ten and eleven years old, and I continued to look for Him until I began to feel very sorry that He would not come and talk with me; and then I felt that I was the worst little boy that ever lived, and that was the reason Jesus would not talk to me. I felt so about it, I wanted to die, and thought it would be just in God to kill me, and I prayed that he would kill me, for I did not want to live to sin against him any more. I felt so for many days and nights. At last, I gave myself up to the Lord, to do what he would with me, for I was a great sinner. I began to see the offended justice of God. O! my readers, the anguish of my heart! I thought the whole world was on me, and I must die and be lost. In the midst of my troubles, I felt         that if God would have mercy on me, I should never sin again. When I had come to this, I felt my guilt give way, and thought that I was a new being. Now, instead of looking with my real eyes to see my Savior, I felt him in me, and I was happy. The eyes of my mind were open, and I saw things as I never did before. With my mind's eye, I could see my Redeemer hanging upon the cross for me.             I wanted all the other slaves to see him thus, and feel as happy as I did. I used to talk to others, and tell them of the friend they would have in Jesus, and show them by my experience how I was brought to Christ, and felt his love within my heart,--and love it was, in God's adapting himself to my capacity.             After receiving this revelation from the Lord, I became impressed that I was called of God to preach to the other slaves. I labored under this impression for seven years, but then I could not read the Bible, and I thought I could never preach unless I learned to read the Bible, but I had no one to teach me how to read. A friend showed me the letters, and how to spell words of three letters. Then I continued, until I got so as to read the Bible,--the great book of God,--the source of all knowledge. It was my great desire to read easily this book. I thought it was written by the Almighty himself. I loved this book, and prayed over it and labored until I could read it. I used to go to the church to hear the white preacher. When I heard him read his text, I would read mine when I got borne. This is the way, my readers, I learned to read the Word of God when I was a slave. Thus did I labor eleven years under the impression that I was called to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ, the ever-blessed God.             Then I learned to write. Here I had no teaching; but I obtained a book with the writing alphabet in it. I copied the letters until I could write. I had no slate, so I used to     
     speaks English better than many of his countrymen, but you will find it a little broken. When will it be convenient that I should send him over to you?               To-morrow afternoon, Sir, if you please.               He shall come to you about four o'clock, and you shall see what you can make of him.              With this promise he took his leave. I felt glad of an opportunity of instructing a native of that land whose wrongs and injuries had often caused me to sigh and mourn: the more so, when I reflected  who  had been the aggressors.             At the appointed hour, my negro disciple arrived. He was a very young looking man, with a sensible, lively, and pleasing countenance.             I desired him to sit down, and said,  your master informs me that you wish to have some conversation with me respecting Christian baptism.               Yes, Sir, me very much wish to be a Christian,  said he.              Why do you wish so?               Because me know that Christian go to heaven when he die.               How long have you had that wish?  I said.              Ever since me hear one goot minister preach                     Where were you born?               In Africa. Me was very little boy when me was made slave by de white men.               How was that?               Me left father and mother one day at home to go get shells by de sea-shore, and as I was stooping down to gather dem up, some white sailors came out of a boat and took me away. Me never see father nor mother again.               And what became of you then?               Me was put into ship, and brought to Jamaica, and sold to a master, who kept me in his house to serve him some years; when, about three years ago, Captain----, my master dat spoke to you, brought me to be his servant on board his ship. And he be goot master; he gave me my liberty, and made me free, and me live with him ever since.               And what thoughts had you about your soul all that time before you went to America?  I asked him.              Me no care for my soul at all before den. No man teach me one word about my soul.               Well, now tell me farther about what happened to you in America. How came you there?               My master take me dere in his ship, and he          stop dere one month, and den me hear de goot minister.              And what did that minister say?               He said, me was great sinner.               What, did he speak to you in particular?               Yes, me tink so; for dere was great many to hear him, but he tell dem all about me.               What did he say?               He say about all de tings dat were in my heart.               What things?               My sin, my ignorance, my know noting, my believe noting. De goot minister made me see dat me  tink  noting goot, nor  do  noting goot.               And what else did he tell you?               He sometimes look me in de face and say, dat Jesus Christ came to die for sinners, poor black sinners, as well as white sinners. Me tought dis was very goot, very goot indeed, to do so for wicked sinner.               And what made you think this was all spoken to you in particular?               Because me sure no such wicked sinner as me in all de place. De goot minister must know me was dere.                      And what did you think of yourself while he preached about Jesus Christ?               Sir, me was very much afraid, when he said de wicked must be turned into hell-fire, For me felt dat me was very wicked sinner, and dat make me cry. And he talk much about de love of Christ to sinners, and dat make me cry more. And me tought me must love Jesus Christ: but me not know how, and dat make me cry again.               Did you hear more sermons than one during that month?               Yes, Sir; massa gave me leave to go free times, and all de times me wanted to love Jesus more, and do what Jesus said; but my heart seem sometime hard, like a stone.               Have you ever heard any preaching since that time?               Never, till me hear sermon at dis church last Sunday, and den me long to be baptized in Jesus' name; for me had no Christian friends to baptize me when little child.               And what have been your thoughts all the time since you first heard these sermons in America? did you tell anybody then what you felt?               No, me speak to nobody but to God den. De goot minister say, dat God hear de cry of de poor; so me cry to God, and he hear me. And me often          tink about Jesus Christ, and wish to be like him.               Can you read?               A little.               Who taught you to read?               God teach me to read.               What do you mean by saying so?               God give me desire to read, and dat make reading easy. Massa give me Bible, and one sailor show me de letters; and so me learned to read by myself, with God's goot help.               And what do you read in the Bible?               O! me read all about Jesus Christ, and how he loved sinners; and wicked men killed him, and he died, and came again from the grave, and all dis for negro. And it sometime make me cry, to tink dat Christ love so poor negro.               And what do the people say about your reading and praying, and attention to the things of God?               Some wicked people dat do not love Jesus Christ, call me great fool, and negro dog, and black hypocrite. And dat make me sometime feel angry: but den me remember Christian must not be angry for dat. Jesus Christ was called ugly black names, and he was quiet as a lamb; and den me remember Jesus Christ, and me say noting again to dem.                     I was much delighted with the simplicity and apparent sincerity of this poor Negro; and wished to ascertain what measure of light and feeling he possessed on a few leading points. St. Paul's summary of religion   *               *  Now abideth faith, hope, charity; these three: but the greatest of these is charity. (I Cor. xiii. 13.)    occurring to me, I said,  Tell me what is faith? what is your own faith? what do you believe about Jesus Christ, and your own soul?               Me believe,  said he,  dat Jesus Christ came into de world to save sinners; and dough me be chief of sinners, yet Jesus will save me, dough me be only poor black Negro.               What is your hope? What do you hope for, both as to his life and that which is to come?               Me hope Christ Jesus will take goot care of me, and keep me from sin and harm, while me live here; and me hope, when me come to die, to go and live with him always, and never die again.               What are your thoughts about Christian love or charity? I mean, whom and what do you most love?               Me love God de Fader, because he was so goot to send his Son. Me love Jesus Christ, because he love me. Me love all men, black men             and white men too; for God made dem all. Me love goot Christian people, because Jesus love dem, and dey love Jesus.              Such was my first conversation with this young disciple; I rejoiced in the prospect of receiving him into the church, agreeably to his desire. I wished, however, to converse somewhat father, and inquire more minutely into his conduct; and promised to ride over, and see him in a few days at his master's lodgings.             When he was gone, I thought within myself,  God hath indeed redeemed souls by the blood of his Son, out of  every  kindred and tongue, and people and nation.  If many of them for a season are devoted to earthly slavery,  *       *  This circumstance took place before the abolition of the British slave-trade.   through the cruel advice of man; yet, blessed be God, some amongst them are, through divine grace, called to the glorious liberty of the children of God; and so are redeemed from the slavery of him who takes so many captive at his will.             It is happy thought, that  Ethiopia shall soon stretch forth her hands unto God. Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth, O sing praises unto the Lord.           
    Dan and Jim Scott, two very wealthy colored  men. They kept hotel, roomers, and ran a gambling  den, all in one building. I had drifted away during  my railroad and sailing careers into a class of company  that led me to this miserable life. It seemed for  a time that all the good that had been accomplished  through my many friends, and self denial and perseverance,  were all overshadowed with darkness, in  immorality and sin. But thank God, on New Year's  night, 1877, while standing at the gambling table, I  heard my mother's voice, as I thought, as audibly as I  ever heard it in my life. She said,  my son,  in that  tender, motherly way in which none save a mother can  speak,  is this what you promised me when you were  wearing the shackles of bondage?            I at once recalled the day when mother left me in  Wilmington to go back to Greenville, Tennessee, when  she said,  son, I have nothing in this world to give  you, but remember that manners and good behavior  will carry you through the world; get the religion of  Jesus in your heart, and if we never meet again on  earth meet me in heaven.  I resolved on that night  that I would not stop until I was converted. All the  entreaties and prayers of my mother came rushing  upon my mind, and I decided at once that they should  not be in vain. My mind fully made up, I left the  gambling den that night, never to enter it again.           The next day I accepted a situation as head cook in  Evanston, Illinois, eighteen miles from Chicago. I  was deeply convicted and began to reason of righteousness,  temperance and the judgment to come. The          more I reasoned, the deeper was my conviction, until  it seemed that the clock on the wall as it ticked said   repent.  I became so interested concerning my  soul's welfare, that I could not keep my mind on my  business, so I began to seek the Lord in prayer. In  June of the same year I walked out of the hotel about  eleven o'clock, didn't stop to draw my money; the train  was due for Chicago and was at the depot when I arrived  there. I was so completely absorbed in thought,  and stirred about the salvation of my soul that I walked  by the train, up the track towards Chicago. It  seemed as though a voice was constantly saying to me,   repent.  I had not walked very far when a voice  said,  you had better pray.  Of course it was the  reasoning of the spirit within. I walked down the embankment  and for the first time since I was ten years  old, I called on God for redemption through the blood  of Jesus. I became so intensely earnest that I did not  notice the section hands working near by. I arrived  in Chicago about dusk, went to a saloon and called for  a drink  -  a very unusual thing for me, because I never  went into a saloon before alone. I had often taken a  drink through the influence of company. But now,  Satan, finding that I was trying to extricate myself  from sin, and from the wrath of a sin avenging God,  made his greatest struggle to impede my progress.  He knew that the wine cup was a sure remedy to  carry out his wishes. I never was a lover of strong  drink, but now I walked up to the bar and called for  gin, as one of the regular hard drinkers would do.            This was one of the remedies that the devil furnished            me to drive away trouble, but it failed in this case;  for I took two drinks and it took no effect whatever  upon me, for my soul was crying for deliverance. I  left the bar room, went to the Union depot and bought  a ticket for La Porte, Indiana, but I got off at a little  station before I got to La Porte, as I thought of a  Baptist preacher I knew about three miles from there. It was midnight, and very dark when I got off the  train. I inquired of the depot agent the way to this  preacher's home. The road lay through a dense,  thick woods, and after wandering until about two  o'clock in the morning I found the place.           I remained at his home about three weeks, and  would go each day to the woods with him and help  him pile up brush, trim trees, etc. I imagined all  the while that a tree was going to fall upon me and  kill me. The very axe the preacher was chopping  with seemed to be crying  repent,  and I became so  troubled that all hunger and thirst seemed to have  left me. There was but one thought uppermost in my  mind and that was,  that I might find peace with  God.            One day the preacher persuaded me to stay at the  house, saying I was too weak to go with him to the  woods. He knew what was ailing me, I could tell  that in his morning and evening devotion, as he would  offer me to the throne of grace with so much fervor.  After he was gone I took the shot gun, saying to his  wife that I would go hunting. I had gone but a short  distance when something seemed to say to me,  you  might as well take that gun and blow your brains out.             Of course this was the reasoning of the devil, making  his last great effort to decoy me and destroy my soul.  But God has promised in His word that He will be  a help in every time of need, and this great truth demonstrated  itself to me in this hour of peril, for when  my foot had almost slipped, and my soul was almost  into eternity  -  where hope is a stranger, and mercy  could never reach my undone condition, the great  spirit of God whispered in my soul,  woe be unto  your damnation.            I hid the gun beneath a brush pile, and started to a  man's house about two miles away. As soon as I went  into the house he told his wife to hurry dinner and  clean up the dinner dishes, and that they would have a  word of prayer. I knelt down behind a big drum  stove in that log cabin, with my mind fully made up  to stay there until God converted me; and in less time  than it will take me to tell it I was happily converted  to Christ.              CHAPTER XXII.            It seemed as though I had been wearing a heavy  logging chain about my body, and in a moment it fell  from me. It looked as if the entire end of the house  had given way, and I could see with that eye of faith  into the very kingdom of God. I expect one day  to behold Christ in His glory, yet I am satisfied that I shall never see Him any plainer, and He will never  look any more natural than He did that day in my  vision. While beholding this great panorama, Christ  handed me a little testament, and pointed towards a  large body of woods, saying,  preach my word to  these people.  In a moment every tree was transformed  into a vast multitude of people, and I stepped  upon a stump, and began to preach from Romans,  First Chapter and sixteenth verse   -    Now I'm not  ashamed of the gospel of Christ; for it is the power of  God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the  Jews first, and also to the Greek.             I need not say to any soul that has been awakened  by the light of the gospel that we bad a wonderful  downpouring of the spirit that day, and of all the  places on earth, that is the dearest to me.            I had worn the shackles of a literal bondage for fifteen  years, but in due season God emancipated me  from being the goods and chattels of other men, so I  could think and act for myself as a man; but thank          God, in 1877, he liberated my soul from a greater  bondage, for human bondage enslaves only the body,  while sin enslaves both soul and body. But I can now  praise God in the highest and sing this song, composed  and sung by my people of the southland. It was a  song of notification, and alluded to the underground  railroad and their preparation for escape into Canada.      Free at last, free at last,    1 	When I was a sinner just like you, 	  2	I never shall forget that day, 	   	  3	The very time I thought I was lost, 	   	  4	This is religion, I do know, 	   	             The first night after I was converted, I lay down  before the fire place  -  for it was a log house, with a  large, old fashioned fire place. The preacher and his  family were eating supper in the same room. He       
     to avoid exciting his evil passions. While learning the shoemaker's trade, I was about eighteen years old. At this time I became deeply interested in my soul's salvation; the white people held a prayer meeting in Fairfield one evening in a private house; I attended the meeting that evening, but was not permitted to go in the same room, but only allowed to go in an adjoining room. While there I found peace in believing, and in this happy state of mind I went home rejoicing and praising the Lord for what he had done for me. A few  Sabbath's  following, I united with the Church in Fairfield. Soon after I was converted I commenced holding meetings among the people, and it was not long before my fame began to spread as an exhorter. I was very zealous, so much so that I used to hold meetings all night, especially if there were any concerned about their immortal soul.             I remember in one instance that having quit work about sundown on a Saturday evening, I prepared to go ten miles to hold a prayer meeting at Sister Gould's. Quite a number assembled in the little cabin, and we continued to sing and pray till daybreak, when it broke. All went to their homes, and I got about an hour's rest while Sister Gould was preparing breakfast. Having partaken of the meal, she, her daughter and myself set out to hold another meeting two miles further; this lasted till about five o'clock, when we returned. Then I had to walk back ten miles to my home, making in all twenty-four miles that day. How I ever did it, lame as I was, I cannot tell, but I was so zealous in the work that I did not mind going any distance to attend a prayer meeting. I actually walked      
     Anthony would hold up to the sun his thin shaving of meat to show what a transparent humbug it was. His lot, however, was not one of unmixed evil, for, through the friendly teaching of a young daughter of his employer, he was enabled to make some further progress in his cherished pursuit of knowledge.             When he had been two or three months in the service of Foote, an accident of a serious nature befell him. He was busy about the discharge of his duties in the mill, when Foote, without giving him warning, set the machinery in motion, and Anthony's hand was caught by a wheel and shockingly mangled.  1      1 The scar, or rather protruding broken bone, which disfigured his hand after the wound had healed, was commonly, but of course erroneously supposed, during his examination, to have resulted from abusive treatment by his master.   This accident laid him aside from work for two months. He returned to Falmouth, where Col. Suttle then had a sheriff's office, and in this was provided with a lodging until he was able to resume his toil. On meeting his owner, he pointed to his broken hand, and significantly remarked,  That's  'anything.'    Col. Suttle did not relish this taunting allusion to his former recommendation of Burns on the hiring-ground.             During this period of suffering and exemption from labor, occurred the crisis in Anthony's religious history. He had been the subject of strong religious impressions from early childhood. His mother, who was a devout woman, had tried to           tell him something about God. He had been excited by the fervors of the camp-meeting. About the same time, the doctrines of Millerism had penetrated the little obscure Virginia county, and filled all hearts with alarm. It became the universal topic; white and black shared alike in the excitement. The barriers of class and caste were, for the time, thrown down, and never before had there been such unreserved communication between master and slave. To this was added a real cause of alarm; the scarlet fever swept over the district, leaving fearful ravages in its path. The young mind of Anthony shared in the general excitement produced by these unwonted causes, and he earnestly set about a preparation for the future life. He would retire into the recesses of the forest to pray, but there no light shone in upon him. Extravagant hopes and terrors alternately possessed him. At one time he looked momently to see Jesus appear in bodily shape before him; at another, believing that he actually saw the Fiend in the form of a serpent, he would spring from the ground, and with frantic outcries rush from the forest. Gradually, his extreme religious excitement subsided, but he never lost the sense of spiritual need. In this condition he remained until the accident occurred which has been already recorded.             Impelled by bodily anguish, and fearing that his injury might terminate fatally, he applied himself with renewed earnestness to the Friend of the afflicted. All at once a thought flashed through his           mind:-- Here have I been praying to Jesus, whom I have never served, and have never thought of praying to the Devil, whom I have always served.  This was a new revelation. He saw it was unreasonable to expect help from a Being whose service he had not entered. He saw that repentance and reformation of life were the first steps for him to take. Thus put upon the right path by the Infinite Spirit working with his spirit, he soon found the help and peace that he sought.             After a suitable lapse of time, he applied to Col. Suttle, according to custom, for leave to be baptized; no slave being suffered to comply with that command of the Saviour or admitted to the church without a written permission from his owner. To Anthony's request, Col. Suttle, irritated by the prospect of loss from the maimed hand, returned a rough refusal, and even added words to wound the spirit of the young convert. If he joined the church, Suttle said, he would soon be drinking or following the women, like others. Anthony turned away with a heavy heart, but still with a silent resolve to pray that God would yet incline his owner to grant his request. The prayer was answered. Returning some time after from Foote's, where he had again resumed his labor in the mill, he unexpectedly met his owner in a carriage, on his way to the Springs. The latter kindly saluted him, and now of his own accord gave the requisite permission for baptism. Emboldened by such rare favor, Anthony petitioned for money to buy clothes in      
       CHAPTER III.     RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCES.           I COME now to a phase in my experience which aroused the impressions made upon me so long before in the blackberry pasture.           At Powell's Fort, not far from where I now lived, was the Mount Asa school-house, where the different religious denominations held their meetings. My master's brother, Jerry Kibbler, and his sister Sally had been to a camp-meeting, and got  religion.  They came home determined their religion should help others; and, through their influence, this little school-house had been fitted up with pulpit and seats, and now there was to be a series of revival meetings held there. I had never been to any kind of a meeting since I was a little girl, and then my mistress had sometimes taken me along for company.           At this time, Miss Ellen Mills was spinning wool at Mr. Jonathan Grandstaff's; and one night, as it was growing dusk, she came down to master's, to see if some of the family would go to meeting with her. No one cared to go; and Miss Lucy, turning to me, said:  There is Betty. Take Betty. She will be company for you.  So I went. The minister was preaching when we entered; and I have no recollection of anything he said in his sermon, but, when he took his seat, he sang the hymn,  -           Then let this feeble body fail,              It was a hymn of many verses (I afterwards got an old woman to teach them to me); and there was such tenderness in his voice and such solemnity in his manner that I was greatly affected. When the singing was over, he moved about among the congregation; and, coming close to me, he said,  Girl, don't you want religion? don't you want to be happy when you die?  Then he asked me to promise him that, when I got home, I would go upon my knees and ask God to give me the witness that I was his. I made him no answer; but, as soon as I reached home and was alone, I knelt down, and in my feeble and ignorant way begged to be saved. From that day to this, I have been praying and trying to do as I thought my heavenly Master has required of me; and I think I have had the witness of the Spirit.           So, night after night, I went to the little school-house, and had many precious seasons. Master Jerry and Miss Sally were very kind to me, and tried to show me the way to be a Christian.           But there came a time when Master David said he was not going  to have me running to meeting all the time any longer. He had decided  to send me up to old Mr. Levers, two miles away, there to stay until  I should get over my  religious fever,  as he called it. Accordingly,  I went as directed; but, when it came night, I asked if I might go  down to Mount Asa school-house for meeting. The old     
                So you like this, Sally?              O mas'r! 'pears like it's what I's been wantin' dis long time.              Well, well,  he answered, as he turned away,  get it if you can.             There was a fervent prayer that none there assembled might be among the lost in the Great Day, and then with shouts, and sobs, and fervent ejaculations, the meeting broke up.            It was almost dark when the servants reached the plantation. In distress and uncertainty Sally lay down that night to sleep, and, for the first time in her life, tried to pray. So guilty did she feel herself, that she would not have dared to do it, if that gentle invitation had not rung in her ears--     Sinner, come to me,                In dreams she lived over the excitements of the day. She was aroused in the morning by the call to labor, and, bewildered, hurried to her plowing in the field. She was not the only anxious one. Many of the servants were awakened, and the usual merriment was hushed. Silently she went her weary rounds. She wanted the Savior, but she know not           how to find Him. Would He accept one so poor as she? And if He would, was she willing to give up all her known sins and follies for His sake? She thought she was, but she was ignorant, and had no one to guide her. She was distracted with her emotions. Her brain seemed on fire. Noontime came, and she stopped her team by the side of the field. The earth seemed to spin around her, and losing her consciousness, she fell, as if lifeless, to the ground. Her companions gathered about her, and bore her to the nearest cabin, where she lay for two days moveless and insensible. On the third day this trance-like state passed away, and she revived and was herself again. And in her dream she believed herself in heaven, and she thought the Lord Jesus came to her with the most loving words, and told her to be His child, and follow his precepts, and He would be with her in every trial, and bring her at last to His  rest and glory.  Then she arose and went cheerfully about her accustomed labor, feeling that she was no longer friendless and alone.             So,  said Aunt Sally,  dat's de way I come through in dis low ground o' sorrow.        
     think,  said she.  Dey laughed when dey heard me talk, an' I could not understand dem, no how.  She described a midnight funeral which she attended; for the slaves, never having been allowed to bury their dead in the day time, continued the custom of night funerals from habit.             The corpse was laid upon the ground, and the people all sat round, the group being lighted up by pine torches.             The old negro preacher began by giving out a hymn, which was sung by all.  An' oh! I wish you could hear 'em sing, Missus,  said Harriet.  Der voices is so sweet, and dey can sing eberyting we sing, an' den dey can sing a great many hymns dat we can't nebber catch at all.              The old preacher began his sermon by pointing to the dead man, who lay in a rude box on the ground before him.               Shum?  Ded-a-de-dah!  Shum, David?  Ded-a-de-dah! Now I want you all to  flec'  for moment. Who ob all dis congregation is gwine next to lie ded-a-de-dah? You can't go nowheres, my frien's and bredren, but Deff 'll fin' you. You can't dig no hole so deep an' bury yourself dar, but God A'mighty's far-seein' eye 'll fine you, an' Deff 'll come arter you. You can't go into that big fort           (pointing to Hilton Head), an' shut yourself up dar; dat fort dat Sesh Buckner said de debil couldn't take, but Deff 'll fin' you dar. All your frien's may forget you, but Deff 'll nebber forget you. Now, my bredren, prepare to lie ded-a-de-dah!              This was the burden of a very long sermon, after which the whole congregation went round in a sort of solemn dance, called the  spiritual shuffle,  shaking hands with each other, and calling each other by name as they sang:                      Harriet's account of her interview with an old negro she met at Hilton Head, is amusing and interesting. He said  I'd been yere seventy-three years, workin' for my master widout even a     
      made of wide plank, with their feet to the fire. The plantation slaves are remarkable for their fine teeth. The slave is never supposed to be sick, unless he is very ill. The ignorant overseer takes for granted that, if the slave complains, he is  acting the 'possum,  and frequently, before the master or physician knows it, the slave dies. The death of a slave is considered a mere money loss. Neighbor A says that  neighbor B has lost a fine slave worth one thousand dollars.              The humble body is buried in the negro graveyard, in some obscure part of the plantation.  For the slave there is no tombstone. The flowers of memory and affection never bloom over the lonely hillock that marks his resting-place. The wild rose and dewberry mat his grave; and the lark builds there her lowly nest, and sings at morn his only requiem. Many an undeveloped poet, orator, and artist lies entombed in such obscure cemeteries throughout the South. A slave-burying is one of the saddest sights I ever saw. They do not cry and weep like freemen; they are sad and stupid. They have no religious services at the           grave, and could not have them if they wished. The negro preacher on the adjoining plantation must not leave his hoe. The white minister is either too grand to bury the slave, or is not called on. I  have never known of more than one white minister of the gospel who has performed religious service at the burial of the slave.              A negro  funeral  is different from the  burying,  and is a unique affair. Several weeks after burial the funeral is  preached;  and never was there more frolic at an Irish wake than at these funerals, held frequently in the woods; and sometimes as many as three funerals are preached at once. Unless a colored person's funeral is preached, whether he be saint or sinner, there is no peace of mind to his friends.             There are 3,000,000 of these slaves in these United States.             The second class of slaves embraces such as owned by the less extensive slaveholders and farmers. These have no overseer, live in the kitchen, mingle with the master's family, eat the same kind of food as the other members of the family, are not generally overworked, use good language for slaves, and are     
   honor to himself, and what was and is far more  imimportant  with honor to his God. When all the others had finished singing and praying, an enquiry was made if he was in the house, when he was brought out from his place of concealment and told to sing, pray, exhort, or preach, or whatever the Spirit of the Lord prompted him to do, and this Scripture came into his mind:  I can do all things, the Lord helping me.  He spoke from these words about twenty-five minutes, then the meeting was dismissed. They told him to remain after the congregation had retired. They placed a chair and he sat down in it, and they propounded various questions, which were answered satisfactorily. They then put their hands on his head and prayed God's blessing up on him in all after life. After this they arose from their knees and gave him the right hand of fellowship, and said  we give you up to go and preach the gospel wherever the Lord may cast your lot and the doors open for you.            He commenced preaching, and the people appeared to receive the word gladly, and when he had gained about fifty converts who were ready to be baptised which ceremony he was not authorised to perform by the Virginia law, he procured the services of Preacher Bowles, and he baptised them. The white people frequently invited Ferrill to their houses to sing for them, as he was considered a great singer, and was sent for, far and near, to preach funeral sermons when the servants would die. On one occasion he went twenty-four miles to Bears Island to preach a funeral sermon. The servants met him at the gate and warned him not to go in, as the overseer, Neill Barnett, had threatened to beat him if he preached on his premises.           The prospect was not very flattering and he even faltered, but thinking of what the Apostles had suffered, he concluded to proceed, let the consequences be what they might. After singing and and praying, he looked out and saw the overseer with two other men, coming toward him, all three armed with clubs and cow hides. The reader may fancy his feelings at this time, and he assures us, that they were of a most unpleasant character. However he commenced his discourse from    
              It is said that the slaves love their masters so much, it is a sin to disturb their peace and harmony. This is as false as the institution itself. To illustrate, let me name one fact, and you will see how the slaves love their masters. There was my uncle Tom, who was owned by Mr. George Harrison, the owner of--Brandon. Uncle Tom, being his head plougher, ploughed wrong one day; so Harrison came to Uncle Tom, and began to beat him very brutally. To escape the whipping, Uncle Tom cried out, (it showed his love for his master!)  Do, pray, my master, don't fret so; I am afraid you will be sick.  It is said the slaves will not leave their masters, they are treated so well. All I have to say is, give them an opportunity, and then see how close they will stick to their  beloved masters.              It is also said, that they have the true gospel preached to them. If this were true, all slaves would be free, and think and act for themselves. Sail on, sail on, sweet times, and let the poor slaves go free!       CUSTOMS OF THE SLAVES, WHEN ONE OF   THEIR NUMBER DIES.              THEY go to the overseer, and  obtain leave to sit up all night with their dead, and sing and pray. This is a very solemn season. First, one sings and another prays, and this they continue every night until the dead body is buried. One of the slaves makes the coffin,--and a very bad one it generally is. Some wheat straw is put in the coffin, and if they can get it, they wrap the body in a piece of white cloth; if they cannot get it, they put the body in the coffin without anything around it. Then they nail up the coffin, and put it in a cart, which is drawn by oxen or mules, and carried to the grave. As they have no tombs, they put all          the slaves in the earth. If the slave who died was a Christian, the rest of the Christians among them feel very glad, and thank God that brother Charles, or brother Ned, or sister Betsey, is at last free, and gone home to heaven,--where bondage is never known. Some, who are left behind, cry and grieve that they, too, cannot die, and throw off their yoke of slavery, and join the company of the brother or sister who has just gone.             When the overseer is in good humor, he will let all the people go to look the last time upon their relative; if he is ill-tempered, he will not let the slaves go at all; so it all depends upon the state of mind the overseer is in, whether the child is permitted to look upon the remains of its parent, the husband upon his wife, the mother upon her child, or any other dear relative. Ah! my readers! think of this, and see the cruelty of the  peculiar institution.  Slaves have tender human feelings,--very warm and tender they are; but it matters not how sorrowful and heavy a heart the poor negro may have, he cannot see his lifeless friends, unless the slaveholder wills it.             When several of the slaves die together, the others go to their owner, and ask him to let them have a funeral. Most of the owners will grant their slaves this privilege. When the owner and overseer give their consent, the slaveholder sends a note to a white preacher; then they set the day, and then the slaves make ready for the funeral services over their friends.             The slaves go to the woods, and make seats to sit upon, (this is done Saturday night.) When the seats are prepared, they are left till the slaves take their seats upon them, and sit until about ten o'clock, when the slaveholding minister comes, and preaches about one hour and a half Then he gives the negroes liberty to sing and pray, and he stands by them. This is to keep the slaves from their master, because         they are not allowed to meet together, except a white man be present. At the funeral, all the slaves from the adjoining plantations obtain passes from their overseers, and come; so this is really a great day for the poor blacks to see each other. If their hearts are sad, they are happy to see their friends, and they all go to some place, and their friends receive such entertainment as it is in their power to give. They stay together till night draws on, and then each leaves for his home. As soon as possible after the funeral, the slaves must go to their work. They have no person to speak a word of comfort to them, to cheer their heavy hearts; but they must go on working and mourning all the day and night. If they had some one to sympathize with them, their burden would be lightened; but no one cares for the tears of the widow, the sighs of the disconsolate husband, the sobbing cries of the mother, whose little son or daughter has been taken from her. No one pities the widow's son, that his mother (who labored all her life for the slaveholder, and for her son, when she could get an opportunity) is gone to the grave, leaving her only one behind, to toil on yet longer beneath the lash of tyrant overseers, and at the mercy of unfeeling slaveholders. Ah! my readers! even in the grave there is more comfort to the sad ones afflicted, than in the prison-house of hopeless slavery. Once, oh Northern reader! visit the auction-block, and all that is human within your soul will be aroused, and you will feel and know  what American slavery is.         HOUSE SLAVES.              WHEN the slave-master owns a great many slaves, ten or a dozen are always employed to wait on himself and family. These are not treated as cruelly as the field slaves; they     
     unlucky enough to be caught, were taken to the cage,  1      1 A place provided everywhere in towns at the South, for the temporary confinement of delinquent slaves.   and the next day rewarded with nine-and-thirty lashes at the whipping post for having peacefully, but unlawfully, assembled to worship God. Anthony was not without experience of this sort, though he was always so fortunate as to escape from the clutches of the officers.             In his new capacity, it sometimes fell to his lot to perform the marriage rite for slaves, or what among them was called such; and sometimes to conduct the burial service for the dead. If a slave died during the week, no funeral was allowed to interrupt the daily toil of the plantation. The body, encased perchance in an orange-box, was deposited in the ground without ceremony or delay, and a few shovelfulls of earth were thrown in, while the bereaved kindred went about their toil as usual. But on the following Sabbath, the whole body of the slaves, attended by the master or the overseer, assembled to  sod the grave.  With prayers, exhortations, and much singing of hymns, in the sad, wild negro airs, this final ceremony was completed.             In death as in life, the social distinctions of slavery are carefully maintained. Laid to rest in a  potter's field,  the dead bodies of the slaves .never mingle their dust with that of the sovereign race. No monument, inscribed with the name of the deceased, ever marks the spot where he lies, as           no legal sanction was ever given to his name while he lived. A rough stone, gathered from the wayside, or a branch of cedar, soon to die, is his only monument. So perish, an undistinguishable throng, the enslaved race of the South. For two centuries the long and ever swelling procession has been moving on in its weary path to the grave, but no name of them all survive, save where, here and there, one has escaped out of the American Egypt, or, Spartacus-like, has risen to take bloody vengeance on his oppressors. A race of many millions has mingled in the very thick of American civilization reaching even into the nineteenth century, and yet their place in human history is a blank.              When Anthony had ended his year of service with Foote, he found a new master in Falmouth. This man, not having employment enough for him, re-let him at the end of six months to a wholesale merchant. The latter proved to be a harsh master, and Anthony refused to remain beyond the expiration of his time, much to the merchant's disappointment. With the new year, he entered the service of a tavern-keeper in Fredericksburg. The annual income which his owner derived from his services had now risen to one hundred dollars, notwithstanding the drawback caused by his lame hand. At the end of the year, true to his secret purpose of frequently changing his place, he sought and obtained a new situation in the establishment of an apothecary in Fredericksburg. While there, an incident occurred that made all his hopes of      
    CHAPTER II.     MY EARLY STUDIES OF RELIGION AND LEARNING--OPPOSITION, ETC.              When I was a small boy I desired two things; one was to be a good Christian, and the other was to learn my book well. I often stole away in private or secret to pray. I often stole away to prayer meetings and preachings. Early, as in good ground, was the precious seed of grace sown in my heart; but like many others, hard trials, whippings, slavery and bad company drew off considerable from these precious feelings; yet, I thank God that I retained them and thought on them, for they hardly left me night or day, until I arrived in the State of Indiana; there I shortly after made a profession of the love of God being shed abroad in my heart, and joined the church. I think we as a race ought to try and get to Heaven, where there is no slavery, or whipping, or selling for gold. O, that God would keep me faithful till death.           When I got to Mississippi, where they work, curse, swear and dance on Sunday, I felt awfully; no preaching or Bible to read, or anything to give consolation, but the whip and hard work; no one called on God for a blessing, but a curse. But I think God it was no worse with me than it was, for many fared worse than I did.           In getting the learning I obtained, I had to buy my book and keep it very secretly. Though very young, say about eight or nine years old, I often carried my book in my hat or     
       CHAPTER IX.             IT is impossible to reconcile the mind of the native  slave to the idea of living in a state of perfect equality,  end boundless affection, with the white people. Heaven  will be no heaven to him, if he is not to be avenged of  his enemies. I know, from experience, that these are  the fundamental rules of his religious creed; because  I learned them in the religious meetings of the slaves  themselves. A favorite and kind master or mistress,  may now and then be admitted into heaven, but this  rather as a matter of favor, to the intercession of some  slave, than as matter of strict justice to the whites,  who will, by no means, be of an equal rank with those  who shall be raised from the depths of misery, in this  world.            The idea of a revolution in the conditions of the  whites and the blacks, is the corner-stone of the religion  of the latter; and indeed, it seems to me, at  least, to be quite natural, if not in strict accordance  with the precepts of the Bible; for in that book I find      
     danger who trust in him, I thought of Deacon Whitfield; I thought of his profession, and doubted his piety. I thought  of his hand-cuffs, of his whips, of his chains, of his stocks, of his thumb-screws, of his slave driver and overseer, and of his religion; I also thought of his opposition to prayer meetings, and of his five hundred lashes promised me for  attending a prayer meeting. I thought of God, thought of the devil, I thought of hell; and I thought of heaven, and  wondered whether I should ever see the Deacon there. And I calculated that if heaven was made up of such Deacons, or such  persons, it could not be filled with love to all mankind, and with glory and eternal happiness, as we know it is from the truth of the Bible.            The reader may perhaps think me tedious on this topic, but indeed it is one of so much interest to me, that I find  myself entirely unable to describe what my own feelings were at that time. I was so much excited by the fierce howling of the savage wolves, and the frightful screams of my little family, that I thought of the future;  I thought of the past; I thought the time of my departure had come at last.            My impression is, that all these thoughts and thousands of others, flashed through my mind, while I was surrounded by  those wolves. But it seemed to be the will of a merciful providence, that our lives should be spared, and that we should not be destroyed by them.            I had no weapon of defence but a long bowie knife which I had slipped from the Deacon. It was a very splendid blade,  about two feet in length, and     
     whither. To one of them she was more particularly attached, and suffered severely on her being taken from her. She herself, was subsequently purchased by  Mr  B. and brought to Boston, Massachusetts. Foul stain on the character of our beloved New-England! Thus divided from all she held dear in this life, and knowing nothing of a better, she sighed, and wished for  death;  supposing that when she died, she should return to her country and friends. This imagination she derived from a superstitious tradition of her ancestors, who, she said, supposed that the first infant born in a family after the decease of a member, was the same individual come back again, just as they saw a young moon appear after the old one was gone away.      
    the white race. He is emotional, loves music, is wonderfully gifted with gab; the organ of alimentativeness largely developed, and is fond of approbation. I therefore try always to satisfy their vanity; call upon them to speak, sing, and pray, and sometimes to preach. That suits for this world. Then I give them a heaven with music in it, and with something to eat. Heaven without singing and food would be no place for the negro. In the cities, where many of them are free, and have control of their own time, they are always late to church meetings, lectures, or almost anything else. But let there be a festival or supper announced and they are all there on time.              But did you know,  said Dr. Gaines,  that the prayer that Ike made to-day he learned from me?              Indeed?  responded the minister.             Yes, that boy has the imitative power of his race in a larger degree than most negroes that I have seen. He remembers nearly everything that he hears, is full of wit, and has most excellent judgment. However, his dovetailing the Cock Robin poetry into my prayer was too much, and I had to laugh at his adroitness.             The Doctor was much pleased with the minister, but Mrs. Gaines was not. She had great contempt for professional men who sprung from the lower class, and she regarded Mr. Mason as one to be endured but not encouraged. The Rev. Henry Pinchen was her highest idea of a clergyman. This gentleman was then expected in the neighborhood,     
      Sukey's Opinion of her Master's Monument.             Sukey, after the Civil War was over, lived near Oakwood  Cemetery. Soon after the erection of a monument to my  father, which was surmounted by a bust under a canopy, I  came to Raleigh on a visit. As usual, she came to see me,  and as she lived near and I had not yet seen the bust, I asked her if she thought it resembled my father. She replied,  It's mity like marster, all but one thing; it ain't got no  arms . Marster was such a busy man, always at work, it ought to have  arms  put to it.   I hope you are getting on well, Aunt Sukey.   Yes, ma'am, I git so full of de Spirit some times you could hear me holler over here (about one mile) if de win' was blowin' de right way. I spect if I eber gits to Heben, de Lord will say,  take Sukey out of dar, for she hollers too loud.         
      the hope I had of being saved was no more than a  hair; still, pray, and it will be sufficient. I then  renewed my struggle, crying for mercy and salvation,  until I found that every cry raised me higher and  higher, and my head was quite above the fiery pillars.  Then I thought I was permitted to look straight  forward, and saw the Saviour standing with His hand  stretched out to receive me. An indescribably  glorious light was  in  Him, and He said,  peace, peace,  come unto me.  At this moment I felt that my sins  were forgiven me, and the time of my deliverance  was at hand. I sprang forward and fell at his feet,  giving Him all the thanks and highest praises, crying,  Thou hast redeemed me--Thou hast redeemed  me to thyself. I felt filled with light and love. At  this moment I thought my former guide took me  again by the hand and led me upward, till I came to  the celestial world and to heaven's door, which I saw  was open, and while I stood there, a power surrounded me which drew me in, and I saw millions  of glorified spirits in white robes. After I had this  view, I thought I heard a voice saying,  Art thou  willing to be saved?  I said, Yes Lord. Again I was  asked,  Art thou willing to be saved in my way?  I stood speechless until he asked me again,  Art  thou willing to be saved in my way?  Then I heard  a whispering voice say,  If thou art not saved in the  Lord's way, thou canst not be saved at all;  at which     
      afore I done asking, an' sometimes he waits jus to see if I trusts him.              Once when we indicated a little skepticism upon this subject, he said:              Massa, don't you know dat de Lord send de ravens to feed de prophet? Him is jus as good now as den.              We chanced to be present when one called with whom he was not acquainted. After entering and shaking the old man by the hand, he said:  Is this Uncle Johnson? I have often heard of you, and have meant sometime to see you. But as I was passing just now something said to me, 'Go in there and give the old man a dollar.' I said, 'I can't do it;' and again something said: 'Go in there, I tell you, and give him a dollar.' So here it is, get anything you please with it.               Yes, massa, thank you, thank you. I tought de Lord would send you dis afternoon. Sit down, sit down.               No, not now, I am in a hurry. I hope you are getting along comfortably. Good-bye.               Hold! hold! Massa! Afore you go I wants to know if you are bound for de           kingdom? May-be I'll neber see you again. Am you bound for dat land of pure delight, where saints immortal reign? Hab you de passport?               The what?               De  passport  all signed and sealed wid de blood of Jesus. You must hab dat, massa, or you neber will get fru de gates ob de city.              In some such manner as this he would improve every opportunity of doing good to those who came in his way. He would with perfect naturalness run all conversation into a religious channel.  Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.  He was perpetually saying such things as declared plainly that he was seeking a country, that is, an heavenly.             His anticipations of the heavenly inheritance were such that at times he thought himself in full possession. Said he:  Sometimes when I'se walking up and down in dis cabin, praising de Lord, I thinks I am in heaven; I thinks dis is one ob de mansions dat Jesus gives his people. Den dis world is under my feet. I jus sees it a great way off, and I jus cries: O my God! am I in glory?                       But how do you feel when you find that you are not there?               I has a long crying, and den I says, I will wait my appointed time.              How long would you be willing to wait?               I will wait anuder hundred Years,  if de Lord please .              Realizing his need of fitness for heaven we heard him praying one night:  O Lord, anoint our souls with angels' balm, that when we have done with dis world we may be at home in glory.              His voice was so strong and his soul so fervent that he was heard in his devotions for a great distance around, especially at evening, in the season of summer. Many were necessitated to hear the accents of prayer and praise, though themselves never uttered them. Some persons doubtless were annoyed by this, and yet in various ways they would indicate their approbation of his manner of life. Many a wicked man laid himself down and rested all the more quietly, by reason of the sense of safety inspired by the prayer he was compelled to hear, before retiring; and many a one was waked to the active duties of a new day by the early     
     upon taking another observation, I found that the arch had moved higher. It was now about forty-five degrees from the horizon. At the east was a large space of steady silver light, tinged with crimson. On a line with this at the west was a similar field of steady glowing silver light. From the edges of these two fountains of light brilliant coruscations emanated, and the whole northern heavens were gorgeously illuminated. All the coruscations were advancing by long and rapid waves to the zenith, where were already to be seen a great number of forms like angels' wings. Gradually these flashed around and settled in clouds as the center of a dark, vivid, immense crimson star, from which extended in every direction long, brilliant, silvery-white rays. Awe-struck, I stood gazing up into the heavens, my heart being filled to its utmost capacity with adoring love to the great Creator of such ineffable beauty and gave utterance to a fervid  Glory to God!   If an angel had darted down to earth from the center of that resplendent star it would have been just what I hoped for. But no angel  desceeded . It flashed away in long waves of silver, to dance about in other shapes. At one period of greatest activity I fancied a sound was produced from the           aurora of a slight crackling, scarcely discernible in the still night air. After eleven o'clock, being fully satisfied, I re-entered the house in profound meditation as to what must be the glories of our heavenly home, as the earth is so full of such perfect beauty. I turned to the Holy Book and read:  And I saw no temple therein, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it. And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon to shine in it: for the Glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.                 
     society, let every man know his own place. But in the church, the beggar and the prince, the white and the colored man, the rich and the poor, the master and the servant, should kneel together. Our Divine Master set us the example of washing the saints' feet. Some think that, in heaven, the negroes will all be made white. I once heard a colored man, in relating his experience in a love-feast, say that, if he should be so happy as to get to heaven, he  expected to have a white face, just like his white brethren!              The M. E. Church has recently sent a missionary to India. Now we have read that in India there exist four castes or classes. Some of these classes will not come in contact with each other. Suppose that some of each class should profess faith in Christianity under Brother Butler, our missionary to India, and that the higher class of Hindoos should refuse to take the sacrament at the same time it is partaken of by the converts of the poorer classes, and that our minister should yield to their claims. What would the church do? Why, she would recall him; and it would be right so to do. Yet every     
    All these things lead down to the pit of damnation. Eyes, what are you about, that you cannot watch for the soul, and not suffer these feet and hands and mouth to do so much mischief to the soul? because, if you do not watch these many members, they will damn the soul to all eternity. It seems that the tongue is an unruly member; James says,  it cannot be tamed; it is unruly, and full of deadly poison; set on fire of hell.  Cannot the eye watch the other members, and keep them from damning the soul, by running headlong into forbidden paths? I condemn all the members, eye, hand and foot; they are all agreed together, to go on and war against the soul. Then the mind must be changed. God keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.            It is out of the abundance of the heart that the mouth speaketh, and with the heart men believe unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. These things do not war against the soul; you have fruit unto holiness, and the end is everlasting life. How much better, then, it is to endeavor to save the soul! Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus, and endeavor to be led by the Spirit of Christ; for if any man have not the Spirit of Christ he is none of his. The Holy Spirit does a great deal; he frees the soul, calms the burning flames and brings the dead soul to life. He provides a heavenly garment, so that when death comes,          it may kill the body, but it cannot kill the soul, because of the blood of Christ. So much, then, for having the mind of Christ. Let all seek to have the mind changed, that we may be led by the Spirit of Christ. In order to be led by the Spirit of Christ, we must be born again; born of that spirit that can lead us from earth to that blessed world of rest, that remains for the people of God.            Come, friends, don't read, and do no more. You must make the inquiry, how stands the case between God Almighty and your soul; and endeavor to receive the Spirit of Christ, that you may be a lively stone in the building, meet for the master's use, cleansed by his blood! A lively stone in the building? We must live godly and soberly in Christ Jesus the Lord, which is your salvation.            Now, I leave this part in your minds, till I look over the world of mankind, and see how many there are that will take heed to their way, and come up unitedly to serve the Lord with one accord, and be the people God wants them to be. For he says,  Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.  Look, now, and see if you are making any exertion in this matter. God  has said it, and you must do it, and do it unitedly; for he judges Israel, and kill them that would not obey. O, Ethiopia, have you obeyed the voice of God Almighty, that spoke by the voice of thunder, to the Israelites on the Mount Sinai? They saw      
      immortality of man, while in the flesh: Praying Jacob. This man was a slave in the State of Maryland. His master was very cruel to his slaves. Jacob's rule was to pray three times a day, at just such an hour of the day; no matter what his work was or where he might be, he would stop and go and pray. His master has been to him and pointed his gun at him, and told him if he did not cease praying he would blow out his brains. Jacob would finish his prayer and then tell his master to shoot in welcome--your loss will be my gain--I have two masters, one on earth and one in heaven --master Jesus in heaven, and master Saunders on earth. I have a soul and a body; the body belongs to you, master Saunders, and the soul to master Jesus. Jesus says men ought always to pray, but you will not pray, neither do you want to have me pray. This man said in private conversation that several times he went home and drank an unusual     
     the slaves in the earth. If the slave who died was a Christian, the rest of the Christians among them feel very glad, and thank God that brother Charles, or brother Ned, or sister Betsey, is at last free, and gone home to heaven,--where bondage is never known. Some, who are left behind, cry and grieve that they, too, cannot die, and throw off their yoke of slavery, and join the company of the brother or sister who has just gone.             When the overseer is in good humor, he will let all the people go to look the last time upon their relative; if he is ill-tempered, he will not let the slaves go at all; so it all depends upon the state of mind the overseer is in, whether the child is permitted to look upon the remains of its parent, the husband upon his wife, the mother upon her child, or any other dear relative. Ah! my readers! think of this, and see the cruelty of the  peculiar institution.  Slaves have tender human feelings,--very warm and tender they are; but it matters not how sorrowful and heavy a heart the poor negro may have, he cannot see his lifeless friends, unless the slaveholder wills it.             When several of the slaves die together, the others go to their owner, and ask him to let them have a funeral. Most of the owners will grant their slaves this privilege. When the owner and overseer give their consent, the slaveholder sends a note to a white preacher; then they set the day, and then the slaves make ready for the funeral services over their friends.             The slaves go to the woods, and make seats to sit upon, (this is done Saturday night.) When the seats are prepared, they are left till the slaves take their seats upon them, and sit until about ten o'clock, when the slaveholding minister comes, and preaches about one hour and a half Then he gives the negroes liberty to sing and pray, and he stands by them. This is to keep the slaves from their master, because     
       to abide with her.   Satan is busy with me,  she would sometimes say,  but my Lord is  stronger than he.   My little house,  said she,  this winter has become a  palace : while  sweeping my room to-day, I thought, I must sweep softly, for He was here, my Lord and  King.              Phebe  was humble.  Her humility drew all hearts towards her. All the attention she received did not cause her for a moment to step aside from her own humble path, in which she  continued to walk, doing her own work, or rather the Lord's, in her own humble, quiet way. She rarely, if ever, spoke first, yet was always ready to respond heartily to the greetings of  her brethren and sisters in Christ. She literally and truly sought out the  lowest seat . Down by the door at the evening meeting sat Phebe, with her head bowed, neither seeing nor  wishing to be seen. Being urged to come up nearer, as she had often been before, it was said to her,  What will you do, Phebe, when you got to heaven?   My Master will tell me where to sit,  she answered. There was a peculiar lowly attitude of spirit and manner which sat on her with a natural grace and beauty, that cannot be described.             Phebe  had no fear of death.  She died as suddenly as her mistress, and now lies by her side in the Pinegrove cemetery, where lie so many of the loved and honoured. She had often  expressed a desire to be placed at her mistress' feet. As she was expecting to die  suddenly  and  alone , she had given the signal to her nearest neighbour, that when she saw no smoke  from her chimney in the morning, she would know that she was gone.  When you hear I am gone home,  said she to the writer of this, the Sabbath before she died,  praise the  Lord.   I shall go soon, very soon. If to-morrow you hear I am gone home to heaven, rejoice and give thanks, and remember, it is well with me.   Jesus, lover of my soul,  she repeated at this, our last Sabbath interview;  yes,  lover,  LOVER, LOVER! How can I better express  it? ' Jesus, lover of my soul. '               A few hours only before she was called away, she came to look on the wife of her pastor, then sleeping      
   Now the poor slave when he is tied to the whipping post and whipped almost to death, he has no father to protect him, and no mother to protect him, and no one to fly to but his Heavenly Father. They have to bear patiently with their hard task masters, and live humble and faithful to God, and then at the end of the warfare God will richly crown them in heaven.           When I was travelling in Foxboro, I fell in among Universalists, and they entertained the way-faring and degraded Aaron very hospitably, and treated me like a brother, minister and all. They wrote considerable for Aaron towards printing in my book, and  throwed  in and helped me to some money towards getting it printed. I staid seven days with them. And I bid 'em good bye, and wished the blessing of God upon 'em. Aaron says he wonders there arn't a thousand Universalists to where there is one. He wonders there arn't a thousand infidels in the world to where there is one, because the white brethren believe in the true light and gospel, and sentiments of the Holy Ghost, and yet set a bad example for their white brethren to stumble over. That is what makes me say it is a wonder there is not a thousand infidels and Universalists to where there is one. Men, again, who live up to the moral law, wont enslave their brethren. Aaron says that no true hearted Christian will begin to hold his brother in bonds. The bible says, he that stealeth a man and selleth him, shall surely be put to death. If he is found in his hands, that thief shall die. If a man hateth his brother whom he has already seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen. God says, in the eyes of man, there is respect to persons, but in his eyes, there is no respect to persons. Whenever a man is cleansed from his sin and iniquity, he is a new formed creature in Christ Jesus. Christ is in that white friend the hope of glory, and he is in Christ, and so therefore there is no respect to persons. He will treat an African brother as well as a white brother. He will not oppress him. If he is a wolf clothed in sheep's clothing, he will stand up and say, it is right to enslave the African brother.--But if he is a sincere, godly man, he will not stand up and say it is right.           When Aaron was in the middle of the town in Wrentham, I fell among several anti-slavery families, and they treated me very coldly, much as ever I could do to get a place to sleep, but the Lord opened the heart of a white brother who had not been living in the place more than six months, who gave me a first rate bed to sleep in, and first rate food to eat. The next morning was a very pleasant one, and I told him if I never saw him no more, that I might have grace to meet him in heaven, and bid him and his family good by.           I fell in with a young minister. * * * * His wife was a short woman of dark hair, and she made out to write Aaron part of a chapter. His wife entertained Aaron very hospitably, she asked me if I would not have something to eat, and I thanked     
      that half had never been told her. History informs us that Solomon was as black  as black satin, with handsome features and smooth skin.             I could refer to many of the colored race whose mental endowments are superior to many of those arrogant white men who abhor a colored man and pretend to be his superior in knowledge.               The language of Jesus Christ to his apostles should teach us not to despise the workmanship of God.  He that despiseth you, despiseth me.  Do men, I ask, realize the awful evil of slavery? Are they aware of its terrible calamities? Has it not become so familiar, from its long existence, as almost to reconcile the tender conscience to its infamous enormities? It must be so. There is no other mode of accounting for the fact, that men, good christians in other respects, quietly hold slaves at the south, while their equally guilty brethren of the     
      here, separated from my Mother, with no friend. Oh, pity me, and do acknowledge that you broke it.               Well, you is crazy, you knows dat I never touched de sacer,  and she laughed heartily.              Come along wid you all. Now far fun,  cried Nace.              Hold your old jaw,  said Jones, and he raised his whip. Nace cowered like a criminal, and made some polite speech to  Massa Jones,  and Mr. Peterkin possessed himself of the rope which Lindy had brought.              Now hold yer hands here,  he said to me.             For one moment I hesitated. I could not summon courage to offer my hands. It was the only resistance that I had ever dared to make. A severe blow from the overseer's riding-whip reminded me that I was still a slave, and dared have no will save that of my master. This blow, which struck the back of my head, laid me half-lifeless upon the floor. Whilst in this condition old Nace, at the command of his master, bound the rope tightly around my crossed arms and dragged me to the place of torment.             The motion or exertion of being pulled along over the ground, restored me to full consciousness. With a haggard eye I looked up to the still blue heaven, where the holy stars yet held their silent vigil; and the serene moon moved on in her starry track, never once heeding the dire cruelty, over which her pale beam shed its friendly light.  Oh,  thought I,  is there no mercy throned on high? Are there no spirits in earth, air, or sky, to lend me their gracious influence? Does God look down with kindness upon injustice like this? Or, does He, too, curse me in my sorrow, and in His wrath turn away His glorious face from my supplication, and say 'a servant of servants shalt thou be?'   These wild, rebellious thoughts only crossed my mind; they did not linger there. No, like the breath-stain upon the polished surface of the mirror, they only soiled for a moment the shining faith which in my soul reflected the perfect goodness of that God who never forgets the humblest of His children, and who makes no distinction of color or of race. The consoling promise,  He            chasteneth whom He loveth,  flashed through my brain with its blessed assurance, and reconciled me to a heroic endurance. Far away I strained my gaze to the starry heaven, and I could almost fancy the sky breaking asunder and disclosing the wondrous splendors which were beheld by the rapt Apostle on the isle of Patmos! Oh, transfiguring power of faith! Thou hast a wand more potent than that of fancy, and a vision brighter than the dreams of enchantment! What was it that reconciled me to the horrible tortures which were awaiting me? Surely, 'twas faith alone that sustained me. The present scene faded away from my vision, and, in fancy, I stood in the lonely garden of Gethsemane. I saw the darkness and gloom that overshadowed the earth, when, deserted by His disciples, our blessed Lord prayed alone. I heard the sighs and groans that burst from his tortured breast. I saw the bloody sweat, as prostrate on the earth he lay in the tribulation of mortal agony. I saw the inhuman captors, headed by one of His chosen twelve, come to seize his sacred person. I saw his face uplifted to the mournful heavens, as He prayed to His Father to remove the cup of sorrow. I saw Him bound and led away to death, without a friend to solace Him. Through the various stages of His awful passion, even to the Mount of Crucifixion, to the bloody and sacred Calvary, I followed my Master. I saw Him nailed to the cross, spit upon, vilified and abused, with the thorny crown pressed upon His brow. I heard the rabble shout; then I saw the solemn mystery of Nature, that did attestation to the awful fact that a fiendish work had been done and the prophecy fulfilled. The vail of the great temple was rent, the sun overcast, and the moon turned to blood; and in my ecstasy of passion, I could have shouted, Great is Jesus of Nazareth!! Then I beheld Him triumphing over the powers of darkness and death, when, robed in the white garments of the grave, He broke through the rocky sepulchre, and stood before the affrighted guards. His work was done, the propitiation had been made, and he went to His Father. This same Jesus, whom the civilized world now worship as their Lord, was once lowly, outcast,           and despised; born of the most hated people of the world, belonging to a race despised alike by Jew and Gentile; laid in the manger of a stable at Bethlehem, with no earthly possessions, having not whereon to lay His weary head; buffetted, spit upon; condemned by the high priests and the doctors of law; branded as an impostor, and put to an ignominious death, with every demonstration of public contempt; crucified between two thieves; this Jesus is worshipped now by those who wear purple and fine linen. The class which once scorned Him, now offer at His shrine frankincense and myrrh; but, in their adoration of the despised Nazarene, they never remember that He has declared, not once, but many times, that the poor and the lowly are His people.  Forasmuch as you did it unto one of these you did it unto me.  Then let the African trust and hope on-- let him still weep and pray in Gethsemane, for a cloud hangs round about him, and when he prays for the removal of this cup of bondage, let him remember to ask, as his blessed Master did,  Thy will, oh Father, and not our own, be done;  still trust in Him who calmed the raging tempest; trust in Jesus of Nazareth! Look beyond the cross, to Christ.             These thoughts had power to cheer; and, fortified by faith and religion, the trial seemed to me easy to bear. One prayer murmured, and my soul said to my body,  pass under the rod;  and the cup which my Father has given me to drink must be drained, even to the dregs.             In this state of mind, with a moveless eye I looked upon the whipping-post, which loomed up before me like an ogre.             This was a quadri-lateral post, about eight feet in height, having iron clasps on two opposing sides, in which the wrists and ankles were tightly secured.              Now, Lindy,  cried Jones,  jerk off that gal's rigging, I am anxious to put some marks on her yellow skin.              I knew that resistance was vain; so I submitted to have my clothes torn from my body; for modesty, so much commended in a white woman, is in a negro pronounced affectation.      
     left immediately, believing that the devil had made a fool of me. I returned to my shop, more determined to pray than ever before.             I arrived, and took my seat, and tried to get under that same weight, that I had felt pressing me down, but a short while before. But it seemed to me that I could not; and, instead of feeling sad, I felt joyful in my heart; and while trying to pray, I thought the Saviour appeared to me. I thought I saw God smiling upon me, through Christ, His Son. My soul was filled with love to God and Jesus Christ. It appeared to me, I saw a fullness in Jesus Christ, to save every sinner who would come to Him. And I felt, that if I was only converted, I would tell all sinners how precious the Saviour was. But I could not think myself converted yet, because I could not see what I had done, for God to pardon my sins. Still I felt a love to Him for what He had done for my soul.             Then I began to think upon my shopmates --and, O what pity ran through my soul for them. I wished to pray for them; but I felt so unworthy, that I could not do it. At last I promised the Lord that if He would convert my soul, I would talk to them.      
      charm. They would come forth as spontaneously as if they were the natural outflow of his soul, as if they were specimens of the rich quarry within, or as if God would thus show what can be wrought in a heart that gives him entire dominion.             One day while he was at work in his garden, singing and shouting, I said:  You seem happy to-day.               Yes, massa, I'se jus tinking.               ' What are you thinking of?               Oh I'se jus tinking;  (and then his emotions prevented utterance.)  I'se jus tinking dat ef de crumbs dat fall from de Master's table, in dis world, am so good, wat will de GREAT LOAF in glory be! I tells ye, massa, dar will be nuff an' to spare dare.              At another time when he seemed very happy and I had heard him shout,  Lord Jesus, will dere be one for me?  I said,  You are having a good time to-day, uncle?  He answered:              O massa, I was meditatin' about Jesus bein'  de Carpenter ; an' so he can make mansions for his people in glory.  And then with uplifted face and with tears he cried out,  O Jesus, will dar be one for me?      
     same neighborhood, but a short distance from each other. But another trial awaited them. Her master removed twenty miles away to a village called Bremen, near St. Louis, Mo. My  father, thereafter, visited my mother once a week, walking the distance every Saturday evening and returning on Sunday evening.  But through all her trials and deprivations her trust and confidence was in Him who rescued his faithful followers from the fiery furnace and the lion's den, and led Moses through the Red Sea. Her trust and confidence was in Jesus. She relied on His precious promises, kind ever found Him a present help in every time of need. Two years after this separation my father was sold and separated from us, but previous to his delivery to his new master he made his escape to a free State. My mother was then left with two children. She had three during the time they were permitted to remain together, and buried one. Their names were Sarah Ann, Mattie Jane and Esther J. When my father left I was about three years of age, yet I can well  remember the little kindnesses my father used to bestow upon us, and the deep affection and fondness he manifested for us. I shall never forget the bitter anguish of my parents' hearts, the sighs they uttered or the profusion of tears which coursed down their sable checks. O, what a horrid scene, but he was not her's, for cruel hands had separated them.             But my mother was conscious some time previous of the change that was to take place with my father, and if he was sold in the immediate vicinity he would be likely to be sold again at their will, and she concluded to assist him to make his escape from      
            I said  Yes.            He said,  You go to dat tree, when you get dare you see nuther tree uther side dat tree, and when you get dare you'll see little grass uther side dat tree, and uther side dat grass dare is big hole and dat is whare de water is.            I went but failed to find  de big hole,  and he upbraided me, saying:  You nice nigger! can't fin dat well when it's bin dare long while, long fore I comed here and you can't fin it!            He took the pail and showed me the well. After we returned he asked:  Do you tink you can fin dat well now?            I said,  I thought I could,  and he sent me for another pailful while he carried in the wood after which we were to have something to eat.           We went into the house and Mistress asked:  Peter, have you done all the chores?             Yes, mam!  said Peter, and we then sat on the floor, Peter in one corner of the fireplace and I in the other; here we sat until Master and Mistress had finished their breakfast when she brought us our mush and milk once more.           Master then came and said,  Peter!             Yes, sir, Master.             Have you finished your breakfast?             Yes, sir, Master.             Go and hitch up the mules and bring them ready to put on the grists for the mill.  We obeyed and the mules were loaded with three sacks of corn on each except two that carried only two sacks each, these last were to be ridden and the others were to be led.            CHAPTER IV.    AT HOME WITH MISTRESS.           Master and Peter went with the mules and I was left to help Mistress do the washing. I was pleased with this arrangement as I liked her better than the Master. She, wishing to learn my skill as a washer, gave me first the baby's soiled clothes, these I cleaned to her satisfaction; she then gave me Master's clothes which I also washed and then she gave me her own clothes, all of which pleased her. She then asked if I could iron? I told her I would try. The clothes were dried and brought in and I ironed all of them. She was kind to me and  complimented  my work saying:  You have done very well, my boy, and now you may sit down and rest.            I sat down, but not to rest. The moment I stopped working a great grief came to me so overpowering I could not conceal my feelings and I began to cry.  She asked me kindly:  What is the matter, Isaac?  I told her,  I wanted to see my mamma.            She tried to pacify me by saying:  Don't cry and fret about that, Isaac, you will see your mother again, Master will buy her and the rest of them sometime.            I asked:  Why didn't he buy them when he bought me?            She replied:  My boy, never mind about that, your mother will be sold again soon and you will be together once more.            I asked:  Who bought her?            Her reply was:  Never mind who bought her, you must not ask questions about such things, not a question, my word is law.            Soon thereafter Master and Peter returned; on entering the house Master asked:  Well, Margaret, how did you get along with the lad?                  She informed him that I had done nicely and that I was a good little worker. His next inquiry was:  Have you taught him how to talk?             No,  she replied,  but he'll learn without any trouble.             That's the next thing he must learn,  he said and then he called in a loud commanding tone:  Isaac, come here!             All right,  I answered.           In an angry voice he said:  All right? is that the way you answer your Master? When I tell you to 'come here' I want you to say, 'Yes, sir, Master,' Now I'll try you once more; Isaac, come here.            I was frightened and again said,  All right.            He was angry. He took up the whip and said:  Isaac, you nigger you, if you don't talk to me as you ought to I shall use this black snake on you. When I call you, you must say, 'yes, sir, Master,' and to your Mistress you must say, 'yes, Madam,' and don't you ever let me hear you say 'all right' to a white man, and when you meet a white man always take off your hat and say 'yes, sir,' or 'no, sir,' and stand to one side till he passes. Remember what I have told you or I shall try the black snake on your back. Now go and help Peter do the chores.            I went, but you can imagine with what a heavy heart. Had it not been for the hope of again seeing my mother and brothers, I would gladly have laid down to die. Why should I be treated in this way; and still this was but the beginning of my new experiences. I helped Peter about the barn, after which we returned to the house for supper. We were allowed only two meals a day and mush and milk were not very lasting. After supper, which was about 5:30 o'clock, Peter and I were sent to the corn crib to shell     
  mind labored in sadness and darkness much of the time.  I read in my Testament that Jesus came from the bright  heaven of his glory into this selfish and cruel world to  seek and to save the lost. I read and pondered with  deep earnestness on the blessed rule of heavenly love  which Jesus declared to be the whole of man's duty to  his fellow: each to treat his brother as he would be  treated. I thought of the command given to the followers  of the loving Savior, to teach all nations to obey  the blessed precepts of the gospel. I considered that  eighteen hundred years had gone by since Jesus plead  for man's redemption and salvation, and, going up to  heaven, had left His work of mercy to be finished by  His children, and then I thought that I and thousands  of my brothers and sisters, loving the Lord and pressing  on to a blessed and endless home in His presence, were  slaves -- branded, whipped, chained; deeply, hopelessly  degraded, -- thus degraded and outraged, too, in a land  of Bibles and Sabbaths and Churches, and by professed  followers of the Lord of Love. And often, such  thoughts were too much for me. In an agony of despair,  I have at times given up prayer and hope together,  believing that my master's words were true, that  religion  is a cursed mockery, and the Bible a lie.  May  God forgive me for doubting, at such times, His justice  and love. There was but one thing that saved me from  going at once and fully into dark infidelity, when such  agony assailed my bleeding heart, -- the memory of season's  of unspeakable joy in prayer, when Love and  Faith were strong in my heart. The sweet remembrance  of these dear hours would draw me back to Jesus  and to peace in his mercy. Oh that all true Christians  knew just how the slave feels in view of the religion  of this country, by whose sanction men and women are bound, branded, bought and sold!          About this time my master was taken sick. On Sunday  he was prostrated by mortal pains; and, on Friday  the same week he died. He left fifteen slaves; I was  purchased by Owen Holmes for $435. I was then in  my twenty-third year. I had just passed through the      
      I felt that it all applied most sweetly to my condition, and I said in my heart, I will come now to Jesus, and trust in him. So when those who felt anxious were requested to come forward and kneel within the altar for prayer, I came and knelt down. While Jacob Cammon was praying for me, and for those who knelt by my side, my burden of sorrow, which had so long weighed me down, was removed. I felt the glory of God's love warming my heart, and making me very happy, I shouted aloud for joy, and tried to tell all my poor slave brothers and sisters, who were in the house, what a dear Saviour I had found, and how happy I felt in his precious love. Binney Pennison asked me if I could forgive my master. I told him I could, and did, and that I could pray God to forgive him, too, and make him a good man. He asked me if I could tell my master of the change in my feelings. I told him I should tell him in the morning.  And what,  he asked,  will you do if he whips you still for praying and going to meeting ?  I said I will ask Jesus to help me bear the pain, and to forgive my master for being so wicked. He then said,   Well, then, Brother Jones, I believe that you are a Christian.              A good many of us went from the meeting to a brother's cabin, where we began to express our joy in happy songs. The palace of General Dudley was only a little way off, and he soon sent over a slave with orders to stop our noise, or he would send the patrolers upon us. We then stopped our singing, and spent the remainder of the night in talking, rejoicing, and praying. It was a night of very great happiness to me. The contrast between my feelings then, and for many weeks previous, was very great. Now all was bright and joyous in my relations towards my precious Saviour. I felt certain that Jesus was my Saviour, and in this blessed assurance, a flood of glory and joy filled my happy soul. But this sweet night passed away, and, as the morning came, I felt that I must go home, and bear the slave's heavy cross. I went and told my mistress the blessed change in my feelings. She promised me what aid she could give with my master, and enjoined upon me to be patient and very faithful to his interest, and, in this way, I should at length wear out his  opposiition  to my praying and going to meeting.             I went down to the store in a very happy state of mind. I told James my feelings.  He called me a fool, and said master would be sure to whip me. I told him I hoped I should be able to bear it, and to forgive master for his cruelty to me. Master came down, talked with me a while, and told me that he should whip me because I had disobeyed him in staying out all night. He had told me he should whip me if ever I did so, and he     
     with everlasting destruction in Hell, if they do not obey the Holy Scriptures and follow after the blessed Lord Jesus who came to earth from Heaven to seek and to save such poor weak sinners as we are. The serpent who tempted Eve to disobey God while she was innocent in the Garden of Eden and had no fear of death except as she was warned not to eat of the tree that was in the midst of the garden,  Lest ye die,  told her,  Ye shall not surely die.  So he continues to contradict all the teaching of our Heavenly Father. In various ways he continues to lure us into all sorts of evil doings, which will surely end in the loss of the precious soul unless we repent and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. Avoid all places where you will be sure to meet the enemy of souls. The saloons, the gaming places (and they are many), the theaters, so attractive from their music and dancing and falseness in general, especially the false view they give of amusement. The poison cup, the dagger of the assassin, the death agonies of the victims of both these fearful agents should never be shown to the public as a fund of amusement; rather of horror, to be kept away from all human beings. Such teachings can only end in producing such fearful fruit as Wilkes      
      forty and two children of them. And I am glad to know that even from the most oppressed slave to the most refined white family's children at the south, are taught to respect the old, white or black. Their children call old colored people aunt and uncle by way of respect. None use the word 'nigger' but the low and vulgar.             Our family theology teaches that God is no respecter of persons, but gave his son to die for all, bond or free, black or white, rich or poor. If we keep his commandments, we will be happy after death. It also teaches that if God calls and sanctifies a person to do some great work, that person is immortal until his work is done; that God is able and will protect him from all danger or accident in life if he is faithful to his calling or charge committed by the Lord. This is a borrowed idea from circumstances too numerous to mention. Here, is one man we present as a proof of the           immortality of man, while in the flesh: Praying Jacob. This man was a slave in the State of Maryland. His master was very cruel to his slaves. Jacob's rule was to pray three times a day, at just such an hour of the day; no matter what his work was or where he might be, he would stop and go and pray. His master has been to him and pointed his gun at him, and told him if he did not cease praying he would blow out his brains. Jacob would finish his prayer and then tell his master to shoot in welcome--your loss will be my gain--I have two masters, one on earth and one in heaven --master Jesus in heaven, and master Saunders on earth. I have a soul and a body; the body belongs to you, master Saunders, and the soul to master Jesus. Jesus says men ought always to pray, but you will not pray, neither do you want to have me pray. This man said in private conversation that several times he went home and drank an unusual     
    slaveholder went to the mother, and began to lay the lash upon her; but it mattered not to her--her little Mary was gone, and now her turn had come. O, mothers, who sit in your comfortable homes, surrounded by your happy children, think of the poor slave mother, robbed so cruelly of her all by a fate worse than death! O, think of her, pray for her, toil for her, even; teach your blooming daughters to think with compassion of their far-off colored sisters, and train them up anti-slavery women! Teach your sons the woes and burning wrongs of slavery; make them grow up earnest, hard-working anti-slavery men. When mothers all do this, we may hope yet to live in a  free country.              Wretched, childless, widowed Jenny was placed upon the block for sale.              Auctioneer -- Gentlemen, here is Jenny,--how much for her? She can do good work. Now, gentlemen, her master says he believes her to be a Christian, a very pious old woman ; and she will keep every thing straight around her. You may depend on her. She will neither lie nor steal: what she says may be believed. Just let her  pray,  and she will keep right.              Here Jesus Christ was sold to the highest bidder; sold in Jenny to keep her honest, to bring gold to the slaveholder. Jenny was sold away from all her little children, never to see them again. Poor mother! who had toiled day and night to raise her little children, feeling all a mother's affection for them, she must see them no more in this world! She feels like great mourning,-- like Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they were not.  So she commends them to the care of the God of the widow and the fatherless, by bathing her bosom in tears, and giving them the last affectionate embrace, with the advice to meet her in heaven. O, the tears of the poor slave that are in bottles, to be poured out upon this blood- stained         nation, as soon as the cup of wrath of the almighty Avenger is full, when He shall say,  I have heard the groanings of my people, and I will deliver them from the oppressor!              Slaveholders carry the price of blood upon their backs and in their pockets; the very bread they eat is the price of blood; the houses they live in are bought with blood; all the education they have is paid for by the blood and sorrows of the poor slaves.             In parting with their friends at the auction-block, the poor blacks have the anticipation of meeting them again in the heavenly Canaan, and sing--       O fare you well, O fare you well,       sisters, fare you well;               Among the slaves, there is a great amount of talent, given by the hand of inspiration; talent, too, which, if cultivated, would be of great benefit to the world of mankind. If these large minds are kept sealed up, so that they cannot answer the end for which they were made, somebody must answer for it on the great day of account. O think of this, my readers! Think of that great day when it shall be said to all the world,  Give an account of thy stewardship!  Among the slaves may be found talents which, if improved, would be instrumental in carrying the blessed Gospel of truth to distant lands, and in bringing the people to acknowledge the true and living God. But all has been crushed down by a Christian world, and by the Christian Church. With these solemn facts written against this nation, see to it, my readers, before this iniquity overthrow you, and it be too late to repent.             The sin of holding slaves is not only against one nation,         but against the whole world, because we are here to do one another good, in treating each other well; and this is to be done by having right ideas of God and his religion. But this privilege is denied to three millions and a half of the people of this our own  free  land. The slaveholders say we have not a true knowledge of religion; but the great Teacher said, when he came on his mission,  The spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor. He hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted; to preach deliverance to the captive, and recovering of sight to the blind; to set at liberty them that are bruised, and to preach the acceptable year of the Lord.  This ought to be the work of the ministers and the churches. Any thing short of this is not the true religion of Jesus.             This is the great command of the New Testament-- Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and thy neighbor as thyself.   Do unto others as ye would that they should do to you,  is the golden rule for all men to follow. By this rule shall all men be judged. We have got to hear,  Come, ye blessed; depart, ye cursed!  These are my convictions, and my belief of the religion of Jesus, the wonderful Counsellor of the children of the created Adam, our great progenitor.             This I respectfully submit to my readers, and earnestly beg of them to renew their interest in the anti-slavery cause, never turning a deaf ear to the pleadings of the poor slave, or to those who speak, however feebly, for him. The antislavery cause is the cause of HUMANITY, the cause of RELIGION, the cause of GOD!       
     stop dere one month, and den me hear de goot minister.              And what did that minister say?               He said, me was great sinner.               What, did he speak to you in particular?               Yes, me tink so; for dere was great many to hear him, but he tell dem all about me.               What did he say?               He say about all de tings dat were in my heart.               What things?               My sin, my ignorance, my know noting, my believe noting. De goot minister made me see dat me  tink  noting goot, nor  do  noting goot.               And what else did he tell you?               He sometimes look me in de face and say, dat Jesus Christ came to die for sinners, poor black sinners, as well as white sinners. Me tought dis was very goot, very goot indeed, to do so for wicked sinner.               And what made you think this was all spoken to you in particular?               Because me sure no such wicked sinner as me in all de place. De goot minister must know me was dere.                      And what did you think of yourself while he preached about Jesus Christ?               Sir, me was very much afraid, when he said de wicked must be turned into hell-fire, For me felt dat me was very wicked sinner, and dat make me cry. And he talk much about de love of Christ to sinners, and dat make me cry more. And me tought me must love Jesus Christ: but me not know how, and dat make me cry again.               Did you hear more sermons than one during that month?               Yes, Sir; massa gave me leave to go free times, and all de times me wanted to love Jesus more, and do what Jesus said; but my heart seem sometime hard, like a stone.               Have you ever heard any preaching since that time?               Never, till me hear sermon at dis church last Sunday, and den me long to be baptized in Jesus' name; for me had no Christian friends to baptize me when little child.               And what have been your thoughts all the time since you first heard these sermons in America? did you tell anybody then what you felt?               No, me speak to nobody but to God den. De goot minister say, dat God hear de cry of de poor; so me cry to God, and he hear me. And me often          tink about Jesus Christ, and wish to be like him.               Can you read?               A little.               Who taught you to read?               God teach me to read.               What do you mean by saying so?               God give me desire to read, and dat make reading easy. Massa give me Bible, and one sailor show me de letters; and so me learned to read by myself, with God's goot help.               And what do you read in the Bible?               O! me read all about Jesus Christ, and how he loved sinners; and wicked men killed him, and he died, and came again from the grave, and all dis for negro. And it sometime make me cry, to tink dat Christ love so poor negro.               And what do the people say about your reading and praying, and attention to the things of God?               Some wicked people dat do not love Jesus Christ, call me great fool, and negro dog, and black hypocrite. And dat make me sometime feel angry: but den me remember Christian must not be angry for dat. Jesus Christ was called ugly black names, and he was quiet as a lamb; and den me remember Jesus Christ, and me say noting again to dem.                     I was much delighted with the simplicity and apparent sincerity of this poor Negro; and wished to ascertain what measure of light and feeling he possessed on a few leading points. St. Paul's summary of religion   *               *  Now abideth faith, hope, charity; these three: but the greatest of these is charity. (I Cor. xiii. 13.)    occurring to me, I said,  Tell me what is faith? what is your own faith? what do you believe about Jesus Christ, and your own soul?               Me believe,  said he,  dat Jesus Christ came into de world to save sinners; and dough me be chief of sinners, yet Jesus will save me, dough me be only poor black Negro.               What is your hope? What do you hope for, both as to his life and that which is to come?               Me hope Christ Jesus will take goot care of me, and keep me from sin and harm, while me live here; and me hope, when me come to die, to go and live with him always, and never die again.               What are your thoughts about Christian love or charity? I mean, whom and what do you most love?               Me love God de Fader, because he was so goot to send his Son. Me love Jesus Christ, because he love me. Me love all men, black men             and white men too; for God made dem all. Me love goot Christian people, because Jesus love dem, and dey love Jesus.              Such was my first conversation with this young disciple; I rejoiced in the prospect of receiving him into the church, agreeably to his desire. I wished, however, to converse somewhat father, and inquire more minutely into his conduct; and promised to ride over, and see him in a few days at his master's lodgings.             When he was gone, I thought within myself,  God hath indeed redeemed souls by the blood of his Son, out of  every  kindred and tongue, and people and nation.  If many of them for a season are devoted to earthly slavery,  *       *  This circumstance took place before the abolition of the British slave-trade.   through the cruel advice of man; yet, blessed be God, some amongst them are, through divine grace, called to the glorious liberty of the children of God; and so are redeemed from the slavery of him who takes so many captive at his will.             It is happy thought, that  Ethiopia shall soon stretch forth her hands unto God. Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth, O sing praises unto the Lord.           
                So you like this, Sally?              O mas'r! 'pears like it's what I's been wantin' dis long time.              Well, well,  he answered, as he turned away,  get it if you can.             There was a fervent prayer that none there assembled might be among the lost in the Great Day, and then with shouts, and sobs, and fervent ejaculations, the meeting broke up.            It was almost dark when the servants reached the plantation. In distress and uncertainty Sally lay down that night to sleep, and, for the first time in her life, tried to pray. So guilty did she feel herself, that she would not have dared to do it, if that gentle invitation had not rung in her ears--     Sinner, come to me,                In dreams she lived over the excitements of the day. She was aroused in the morning by the call to labor, and, bewildered, hurried to her plowing in the field. She was not the only anxious one. Many of the servants were awakened, and the usual merriment was hushed. Silently she went her weary rounds. She wanted the Savior, but she know not           how to find Him. Would He accept one so poor as she? And if He would, was she willing to give up all her known sins and follies for His sake? She thought she was, but she was ignorant, and had no one to guide her. She was distracted with her emotions. Her brain seemed on fire. Noontime came, and she stopped her team by the side of the field. The earth seemed to spin around her, and losing her consciousness, she fell, as if lifeless, to the ground. Her companions gathered about her, and bore her to the nearest cabin, where she lay for two days moveless and insensible. On the third day this trance-like state passed away, and she revived and was herself again. And in her dream she believed herself in heaven, and she thought the Lord Jesus came to her with the most loving words, and told her to be His child, and follow his precepts, and He would be with her in every trial, and bring her at last to His  rest and glory.  Then she arose and went cheerfully about her accustomed labor, feeling that she was no longer friendless and alone.             So,  said Aunt Sally,  dat's de way I come through in dis low ground o' sorrow.        
              I remember, when a child, our parents used to tell us that we would not  be  always slaves. It made me feel glad  to  think that I would be free some day  or  other. Though  very young I always felt that I would like to know how to read and write, but had no one to teach me.  I often heard the white people say that they did not want the negro to learn to read and write. Then I felt satisfied that there was something more than learning to read and write that they did not want the negro to know. When I would hear any one reading I would always go and stand around and listen. They often asked  me  what I wanted. I would always say  nothing,  but go and tell my father and mother, and they would say,  try to hear all you can, but don't let them know it.  When an election was going on they did not want the negro to know anything then, but I tried to learn all I could  so  that I might tell father and mother.   [damaged page]   was very young and sickly at that time and if it had not been for that I could        
                It was nearly rolling season when Aunt Jane first came to Louisiana, and we all was so busy working night and day I did not have a chance to see her in a long time after I left her that Sunday evening. But two or three months after that I got a chance to go to see her again. Old marster let me go and stay all day that Sunday. He said we all had made such a good year's work, and he was mighty well pleased with us. But he was not always glad and pleased with us. Sometimes he would get mad about something going wrong on the place, and he would beat every one of us and lock us up in the jail he made for us.               What! Did he put you in jail on Sunday?               Yes; 'most every Sunday morning when we did not have any work to do. The next time I went to see Aunt Jane we had another happy time. She could read right good in the Bible and hymn-book, and she would read to me one or two hymns at a time. I remember she read to me about Daniel in the lions' den, and about the king having the three Hebrew children cast in the fiery furnace, and when he looked in the flames of fire he saw four men,          and one looked like the Son of God. O, how Aunt Jane used to love to read about the Hebrew children!              I finally got religion, and it was Aunt Jane's praying and singing them old Virginia hymns that helped me so much. Aunt Jane's marster would let her come to see me sometimes, but not often. Sometimes she would slip away from her place at night and come to see me anyhow. She would hold prayer-meeting in my house whenever she would come to see me.               Would your marster allow you to hold prayer-meeting on his place?               No, my child; if old marster heard us singing and praying he would come out and make us stop. One time, I remember, we all were having a prayer-meeting in my cabin, and marster came up to the door and hollered out,  'You, Charlotte,  what's all that fuss in there?' We all had to hush up for that night. I was so afraid old marster would see Aunt Jane. I knew Aunt Jane would have to suffer if her white people knew she was off at night. Marster used to say God was tired of us all hollering to him at night.       
       Thy work now begins in my vineyard; go out upon the highways and cry aloud.  But I excuse myself,  saying:  I don't know what to cry.  And the Lord  say:  I put in thy heart and in thy mouth what to  say. Fear not, for I will be with thee, and bring thee  off conqueror and more than conqueror.  And about this time, when in my bed, I was often attended with visions, with views of congregations sitting to hear the Word.            For a long time I cry, unworthy to undertake the task; but God at length prepare, and I promised to do the best I could. And  God prepare me to this day.  And when it come, I do the best I can.            I was twenty-three years old when I did not know a letter; after that I managed, for two months, to go two nights in a week to see a black maid who  could  spell a little, and she instructed me to spell in three syllables; and that was  all the learning I got from human. After that my Heavenly Master took me in hand and nursed me, and learned me to read the Bible to good understanding. He first give me faith, then  He revealed to me.  But most other books I have tried to read is a mystery to me. From the time of my conversion to this moment, I have never doubted the grace of God; for I have found all doubting comes from a wicked heart. I do feel, while I am relating this to you, that I have great cause to bless the Lord, for he has nursed me through all the journey of my life, and has been my comforter in distress, when trouble, like a gloomy cloud, has overshadowed me  by the loss of three of my children--being taken from  my bosom, sold and taken South. But here I got some consolation, reflecting upon  Joseph being sold into Egypt.  Like Jacob,     
    CHAPTER II.     MY EARLY STUDIES OF RELIGION AND LEARNING--OPPOSITION, ETC.              When I was a small boy I desired two things; one was to be a good Christian, and the other was to learn my book well. I often stole away in private or secret to pray. I often stole away to prayer meetings and preachings. Early, as in good ground, was the precious seed of grace sown in my heart; but like many others, hard trials, whippings, slavery and bad company drew off considerable from these precious feelings; yet, I thank God that I retained them and thought on them, for they hardly left me night or day, until I arrived in the State of Indiana; there I shortly after made a profession of the love of God being shed abroad in my heart, and joined the church. I think we as a race ought to try and get to Heaven, where there is no slavery, or whipping, or selling for gold. O, that God would keep me faithful till death.           When I got to Mississippi, where they work, curse, swear and dance on Sunday, I felt awfully; no preaching or Bible to read, or anything to give consolation, but the whip and hard work; no one called on God for a blessing, but a curse. But I think God it was no worse with me than it was, for many fared worse than I did.           In getting the learning I obtained, I had to buy my book and keep it very secretly. Though very young, say about eight or nine years old, I often carried my book in my hat or        pocket, for fear of detection, and hid it in the leaves or earth for fear of the lash or detection, for it was against all the laws of Virginia for slaves or blacks to be taught to read or write; but by hard study and labor, and much secrecy, and the assistance of some little white boys and girls, I managed to gain some information. While the slave boys would be playing marbles, my attention would be on my book; often, when I would be looking on my book, the approach or sight of a white man made me put it aside. In this situation, how I have mourned for a little instruction.           Finally, after Providence had smiled on me, and I could read a little, I then desired to learn to write. My copies were old scraps of writing that I could pick up at times. Then, after my day's work was over, by fire-light I would practice upon my lessons in writing. In passing on during the day, when I had an opportunity I would stoop down and practice a little in thousand, but when the old slaveholder saw it, he would tell me that I was studying philosophy, and that he would whip it out of me, etc., etc.           Thus, I thank God, I made such advancement that I could read and write considerable. There being many in my condition who wanted to learn very badly, they persuaded me to teach them a little on Sundays; so we went on teaching and learning a few Sundays before the white people found it out, and gave us our orders never to meet for instructions any more, on the peril of the lash; and our little school was broken up forever.           Then I was watched closely the balance of the time I staid in Virginia, so the reader may account for my imperfections in my simple narrative and tale. But here, Christian reader, my heart runs out in thanks to God for his great blessings toward me, who, I must acknowledge, as David said,  The Lord is my  sheperd,  I shall not want; surely goodness and     
              In giving the foregoing brief sketch of the life and character of Joice Heth, the writer of this has but one single motive, and that is of charity towards the descendants of this living monument of antiquity.             She has outlived all her descendants save five, and they are her great grand-children, who are now held in bondage by a respectable gentleman of Kentucky, who has generously offered to set them free on being paid two-thirds they cost him. This work, together with what may be collected from exhibition, after deducting expenses, is expressly for that purpose, and will be immediately done whenever there can be realized the sum to do it. Two of them are said to be uncommonly intelligent and active, quick to learn, and great favorites of their master. In consequence of his partiality towards them, they have been instructed to read, and have acquired by their assiduous application upon the Sabbath, a knowledge of the scriptures, of which they are very fond to learn. It is designed that they shall be instructed in the glorious truths of the gospel, so as to become fully qualified to teach their poor unfortunate race the true way to future happiness.             If such should be the case, the writer of this little work would feel himself amply compensated for all his labor, by the happy reflection of having been instrumental, through the favor of the Lord, in opening a new channel through which might flow freely and effectually to those unfortunate beings, the glorious     
     who, for several years past, have been supported at the mission stations in Africa by the scholars and teachers of Grace Church Sunday school in this city, and by their request he was named A. V. Griswold.             His improvement at the Mission school was very satisfactory, particularly in view of the fact, that a foreign language was to be acquired before he could advance a step in other studies. We found him, after only a few years' instruction by our missionaries in Africa, well versed in the scriptures, and the doctrines and services of our Church, in grammar, geography, arithmetic, and writing, and no stranger to the study of philosophy and astronomy.             The following extract from the notice referred to, will show the impression produced on those who saw him soon after his arrival in Boston, in October, 1843:              He reads fluently and without embarrassment, and whoever had the privilege and pleasure of witnessing his interesting examination, which     
      CHAPTER II.              A fruitless effort for education.--The Sabbath among Slaves.-- Degrading amusements.--Why religion is rejected.--Condition of poor white people.--Superstition among slaves.--Education forbidden.              IN 1833, I had some very serious religious impressions, and there was quite a number of slaves in that neighborhood, who felt very desirous to be taught to read the Bible. There was a Miss Davis, a poor white girl, who offered to teach a Sabbath School for the slaves, notwithstanding public opinion and the law was opposed to it. Books were furnished and she commenced the school; but the news soon got to our owners that she was teaching us to read. This caused quite an excitement in the neighborhood. Patrols  *               *Police peculiar to the South.    were appointed to go and break it up the next Sabbath. They were determined that we should not have a Sabbath School in operation. For slaves this was called an incendiary Movement.             The Sabbath is not regarded by a large number of the slaves as a day of rest. They have no schools to go to; no moral nor religious instruction at all in many localities where there are hundreds of    
      and we saw hard times. The old man had a son, a preacher. At times he came home, but he could not help our case. I was anxious to learn to read. My master had two sons who went to school, and four unmarried daughters. One Sunday a gentleman came to our house: I held his horse, and he gave me a sixpenny bit, with which I bought a book, and tried to learn to read. I had it but a week, when the old man saw it in my bosom, and made inquiry as to what it was. He said,  You son of a b--h, if I ever know you to have a book again, I will whip you half to death.  He took the book from me, and burnt it! What could I do? I was a slave; and the mind which God had given me, in common with my brethren with white skins to be enlightened, must be kept darkened, and remain in ignorance, to suit the policy of the  peculiar institution.              I omitted to mention that Mr. Buk came to see Miss Jane, one of the unmarried daughters,           at the time he gave me the piece of money. The same attraction drew him there again, and he then gave me eleven pence, with which I purchased a larger book, thirsting for that knowledge which was denied me; but I had not had this book over a week before my master found it out; and he then made me sick of books by beating me like a dog. He whipped me so very severely that he overcame my thirst for knowledge, and I relinquished its pursuit until after I absconded. He took my book from me, and gave it to his son--so it seems the white man's son must have the means of education, even if stolen from the slave. I could do nothing; but the all-merciful Father, who regards MAN as MAN, whatever may be the injustice and oppression to which he is subjected, watched over and guided me with his parental eye through all the soul-sickening, heart-rending trials of a gloomy bondage. I can prove by the scriptures that slave-holders are worse     
     than there now is. Hence we are willing to believe, that if the master and mistress of this poor, oppressed girl, whose story is here related, and whom they named  Chloe , had lived in our day, they would have dealt very  differently by her from what they then did. But at that time, here, as now in many parts of the world, slaves were considered  property , and their owners thought themselves under no more obligations to  instruct  them, otherwise than to do their work in such a manner as best to subserve their own interests, than farmers do, to take, their horses and oxen into their houses, instead of the pasture or the barn. With such views, it is not singular that Chloe was taught nothing, comparatively, of her duty          to God, nor to read the blessed Bible. She was, it is true, sent to meeting half the day on the Sabbath;  but the seat assigned to herself  and her associates was remote from the view of the congregation; and she confessed, that as they did not understand the preaching, they took no interest in it, and spent the time in playing, eating nuts,  c. and derived no benefit whatever, though the preaching probably was evangelical.             It was close personal instruction that she needed, to discover to her the beauty of religion, and her condition as a sinner. This she did not receive. But, being favoured by the munificent Author of her existence, with superior intellectual powers, which, if cultivated, would          have raised her above many of a different complexion; when, (as she was accustomed to do,) she went to conduct the children of the family to, and from  school , she discovered that the were obtaining something of which she remained ignorant. This excited an inclination to learn to read, and after becoming a little acquainted with the school-mistress, who, it would  seem, manifested some sympathy for the enslaved youth, she ventured to express her desire.             How to accomplish her object, was a question which required consideration. She was aware that it would not do to make known her wishes at home, and she could not attend at the regular school hours, both for want of time, and because          the children would expose the fact to their parents. But after some reflection, an expedient was devised that promised success.  So,  said Chloe,  I ask de Mistress how much she hab week to teach me such time I get when school out, and my work done? She say,  'five  copper,'   *               *This  was previous to the coinage of  cents.     so she would chalk down mark, how many day I go, till make a week. She say too,  I mus bring book.              To these conditions she agreed, as she occasionally received small presents of money from  visiters  at the house of her master.             Delighted with the prospect, she hastened to a bookseller's shop, and desired him to sell her a book. He asked, what book? She answered          that she did not know; she wanted a  book . He asked what money she had brought? She did not know this neither, but showing him her piece of silver, he found it to be a twenty-cent piece. Whether the  bookseller willingly took advantage of her ignorance, or whether he supposed she was sent to purchase a book of that value, we cannot  decide; but he gave her a  Psalter,  which contained the Psalms, Proverbs, and our Lord's Sermon on the  mount. An unsuitable book indeed, on which to teach an untutored African her alphabet! but this event Chloe afterwards had occasion to review as a peculiar providence.             By diligence in her domestic avocations, and so much application to, study as circumstances would          permit, she learned her letters, and became quite interested in attempting to spell. She kept the book secreted in her pocket, and whenever she had a few moments leisure, she would take it out and try to spell a word. While thus engaged one day, her master discovered the book in her hand, and inquired what she was doing. She told the truth,  *               * She told the truth!  What an example is this to all children and youth. Had Chloe done as have many who were better taught than she, no doubt she might for a time, have escaped the reproofs of her master, and possibly have continued to attend  her school. But her  conscience  must all her life long have been accusing her of  lying , and this would have been far worse than what she endured in consequence of the deprivation she suffered; for it is better to suffer wrong, than to do wrong. Besides, she would in all probability have been detected at some future period, and then the  mortification , in addition to the guilt, would have been a severe aggravation of her punishment. But what is greater than all, she would have  sinned against God , and thus have exposed herself to his holy displeasure.    and this led to a full disclosure          of the case. He angrily forbade her going again to the schoolmistress for instruction, even under penalty of being suspended by her two thumbs, and severely whipped; he said it made negroes saucy to know how to read,  c.            This was truly an afflictive stroke to poor Chloe, but she was obliged to submit as well as she could, and altogether to desist from going to school. She however hid her book under her pillow, and when not likely to be detected, she used to labour over it, and strive to remember what she had learned, and to find out as much as she could herself;  *                *Such patient diligence, and persevering effort, under these trying and discouraging circumstances, discover traits of a strong and penetrating genius, which would be highly creditable to an enlightened student, and most powerfully reprove those children of kind and attentive parents, who are constantly prompting them to the improvement of their minds by personal instruction, and by affording them superior advantages of a literary character; but who are still negligent and remiss in their attention to study.   and years afterward, even late           in life, she frequently spoke of it as a striking providence, that the first verse she was able to spell out, so as to understand it, was Psalm xxxv. 1.  Plead my cause, O Lord, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me.  She had gathered some ideas of a Supreme Being, and had imbibed a sort of confidence in his justice; and feeling herself unjustly treated by man, she found some consolation in the hope of redress from a higher Power, still longing for release by death. As she progressed in spelling, she perceived that her own feelings were expressed in other passages, particularly Psalm lxxi. 4.           Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.              By these things she was led to believe, that a kind Providence had placed the scriptures of truth in her way, to be a comfort to her, even in that dark state. Had it been a common spelling-book, instead of a Psalter, she could not have derived this advantage. The spelling-books of that day, it is well known, differed widely in point of religious instruction, from those of a more recent date. Few, if any portions of scripture were inserted. Had it even been otherwise, those of which she here speaks, are less adapted to such a work, than many others. We may therefore safely conclude with her, that it was providential.                    How far the passages of scripture she mentions were applicable to  the conduct of Mr B. it is not our province to determine; but it is not strange that they should have served to sustain an individual so situated. She felt an ardent desire to learn to read, and that she was unreasonably  opposed  in this undertaking. It must therefore have afforded a sort of solace to her feelings to find that some one had been oppressed as well as herself, and that there was some ground of hope for her likewise. She appeared, however, not to have possessed, and certainly not to have retained, a revengeful spirit.             The valuable improvement she made of the very scanty advantages          she enjoyed, strikingly shows that her master indulged a mistaken idea in supposing that the  natural  results of education were unfavourable. Education, like  health , or  property , may be misimproved, and turned to a bad account; but health and property, if rightly improved, are among our greatest blessings, and so is education in all its various grades, as experience has amply proved. And we who are so happy as to live in brighter days, should look back with pity, as well as disapprobation, on those who have erred on this point, and forward, with joyful anticipations, to succeeding generations, while the tide of improvement shall roll on, and its current become more and more broad and rapid, till knowledge, even the  knowledge of            the Lord,  which is the grand climax of education, shall cover the earth as the waters do the sea.             The most direct and certain method of securing to ourselves the reasonable services of domestics, or children, is to afford them such instruction, as will discover to their understandings, the nature of the duties they owe both to God, and man; thus rendering it plain to their perception, that their personal happiness is inseparably connected with their  obedience  and  faithfulness  in the fulfilment of those duties.       
     faults; this made me often tremble and weep, but I escaped better than many of them. For eating a piece of sugar-cane, some were cruelly lashed, or struck over the face, to knock their teeth out. Some of the stouter ones, I suppose, often reproved, and grown hardened and stupid with many cruel beatings and lashings, or perhaps faint and pressed with hunger and hard labour, were often committing trespasses of this kind, and when detected, they met with exemplary punishment. Some told me they had their teeth pulled out, to deter others,  and to prevent them from eating any cane in future. Thus  seeing my miserable companions and countrymen in this pitiful,  distressed, and horrible situation, with all the brutish baseness and barbarity attending it, could not but fill my little mind horror and indignation. But I must own, to the shame of my own  countrymen, that I was first kidnapped and betrayed by some of my own complexion, who were the first cause of my exile, and slavery; but if there were no buyers there would be no sellers. So far as I can remember, some of the Africans in my country keep slaves, which they take in war, or for debt; but those which they keep are well fed, and good care taken of them, and treated well; and as to their clothing, they differ according to the custom of the country. But I may safely say, that all the poverty and misery that any of the inhabitants of Africa meet with among themselves, is far inferior to those  inhospitable regions of misery which they meet with in the  West-Indies, where their hard-hearted overseers have neither Regard to the laws of God, nor the life of their fellow-men.            Thanks be to God, I was delivered from Grenada, and that horrid brutal slavery. A gentleman coming to England took me for his servant, and brought me away, where I soon found my situation become more agreeable.  After coming to England, and seeing others write and read, I           had a strong desire to learn, and getting what assistance I could, I applied myself to learn reading and writing, which soon became my recreation, pleasure, and delight; and when my master perceived that I could write some, he sent me to a proper school for that purpose to learn. Since, I have endeavoured to improve my mind in reading, and have sought to get all the intelligence I could, in my situation of life, towards the state of my brethren and countrymen in complexion, and of the miserable situation of those who are barbarously sold into captivity, and unlawfully held in slavery     FINIS.

     had reached my twelfth year, that if I was spared to become a man, I would try to be as good as my parents. My father could read a little, and make figures, but could scarcely write at all. His custom, on those Sabbaths when we remained at home, was to spend his time in instructing his children, or the neighboring servants, out of a New Testament, sent him from Fredericksburg by one of his older sons. I fancy I can see him now, sitting under his bush arbor, reading that precious book to many attentive hearers around him.             Such was the esteem I had for my pious father, that I have kept that blessed book ever since his death, for his sake; and it was the first New Testament I read, after I felt the pardoning love of God in my soul.             My father died, August 20, 1826, aged 60 years. My mother, Jane Davis, at the death of my father, removed from the farm, where my father died, and spent the remainder of her days in Fredericksburg, with her children. She lived to good old age, and fell asleep in Jesus, Dec. 24, 1831.             My father had been allowed to keep a cow and horse, for his own use; and to raise and feed his hogs and poultry from the mill.--     
      deepest sympathy with me, and the most decided hatred of slavery. They went so far as to tell me that I ought to run away and go to the north; that I should find friends there, and that I should then be as free as anybody. I pretended not to be interested in what they said, for I feared they might be treacherous. White men were not unfrequently known to encourage slaves to escape, and then, to get the reward, they would kidnap them and return them to their masters. While I mainly inclined to the notion that these men were honest and meant me no ill, I feared it might be otherwise. I nevertheless  remembered their words and their advice, and looked forward an escape to the north as a possible means of gaining the liberty for which my heart panted. It was not my enslavement at the then present time which most affected me; the being a slave  for life  was the saddest thought. I was too young to think of running away immediately; besides, I wished to learn to write before going, as I might have  occasion to write my own pass. I now not only had the hope of freedom, but a foreshadowing of the means by which I might some day gain that inestimable boon. Meanwhile I resolved to add to my educational attainments the art of writing.             After this manner I began to learn to write. I was much in the ship-yard--Master Hugh's, and that of Durgan   Bailey, and I observed that the carpenters, after hewing and getting ready a piece of timber to use, wrote on it the initials of the name of that part of the ship for which it was intended. When, for instance, a piece of timber was ready for the starboard  side, it was marked with a capital  S.  A piece for the larboard side was marked  L.;  larboard forward was marked  L. F.;  larboard aft was marked  L. A.;  starboard  aft,  S. A.;  and starboard forward  S. F.  I soon learned these letters, and for what they were placed on the timbers.             My work now was to keep fire under the steam-box, and to watch the ship-yard while the carpenters had gone to dinner. This interval gave me a fine opportunity for copying the  letters named. I soon astonished myself with the ease with           which I made the letters, and the thought was soon present,  If I can make four letters I can make more.  Having made these readily and easily, when I met boys about the Bethel church or on any of our play-grounds, I entered the lists with them in the art of writing, and would make the letters which I had been so fortunate as to learn, and ask them to  beat that if they could.  With play-mates for my teachers, fences and pavements for my copy-books, and chalk for my pen and ink, I learned to write. I however adopted, afterward,  various methods for improving my hand. The most successful was copying the  italics  in Webster's spelling-book until I could make them all without looking, on the book. By this time my little  Master Tommy  had grown to be a big boy, and had written over a number of copy-books and brought them home. They had been shown to the neighbors, had elicited due praise, and had been laid carefully away. Spending parts of my time both at the ship-yard and the house, I was often the lone keeper of the latter as of the former. When my mistress left me in charge of the house I had a grand time. I got Master Tommy's copy-books and a pen and ink, and in the ample spaces between the lines I wrote other lines as nearly like his as possible. The process was a tedious one, and I ran the risk of getting a flogging for marking the highly-prized copy-books of the oldest son. In addition to these opportunities, sleeping as I did in the kitchen loft, a room seldom visited by any of the family, I contrived to get a flour-barrel up there and a chair, and upon the head of that barrel I have written, or endeavored to write, copying from the Bible and the Methodist hymn-book, and other books which I had accumulated, till late at night, and when all the family were in bed and asleep. I was supported in my endeavors by renewed advice and by holy promises from the good father Lawson, with whom I continued to meet and pray and read the Scriptures. Although Master Hugh was aware of these meetings, I must say for his credit that he never executed his threats to whip me for having thus innocently employed my leisure time.         
  by the name of Mary Burnepp, of Vermont, in all there  were sixteen. I fell, fortunately, the department taught  by Miss Ella Roper, and Miss Mary Burnepp, and Kate Freeman, and many other too tedious to mention now.                Early in the spring of 1864, April, I entered the school,  with Miss Roper as my teacher, where my progress was so  rapid, I ascended to the head of the first class in school,  and no scholar in school or on the Island could compete  with me, in consequence of which I was made assistant  teacher. When I began to write, I learned to make my  alphabet in one night. The first copy book I ever had I  wrote it up the first night - every page. My teacher set me  no more alphabet, and the first copy of writing was this -     Improve each shining hour.            By reason of study, my health grew bad, and my eyesight  failed me. I made a profession of religion in September,  1864. Before I repented of my sins, I was elected superintendent  of the Sabbath School. Some time in May, the same  year, Rev. Andrew Cartwright lectured the Sabbath school  on the subject of Repentance. I was then honored to the  position in the Sabbath school as Superintendent, but had  not made any profession of faith in Christ, and the language  falling from the mouth of God's servant, touched my heart.  He was followed by my father, and all that each said seemed  to rest on me. By their words used relative to teachers  teaching what they really knew nothing of; then in strong  terms showed that all my instruction given as Superintendent,  would prove to me, without repentance, my eternal  destruction. Then I was convicted, and from that time,  until I manifested a hope, I could not, nor did not, open  school any more. And at a revival in September, 4th Sunday,  about eight o'clock, P. M., I received the Pearl of Great  Price. Soon after, I was nominated and elected Secretary  of church and Board of Trustees.          All the teachers and scholars and members of the church  apparently appreciated me for my usefulness in church,     
      SKETCH OF THE LIFE   OF THE   REV. LOTT CARY.             THE Rev. LOTT CARY was born a slave, near Richmond, Virginia, and was early hired out as a common laborer in that city, where, for some years, he remained, entirely regardless of religion, and much addicted to profane and vicious habits. But God was pleased to convince him of the misery of a sinful state, and in 1807, he publicly professed his faith in the Saviour, and became a member of the Baptist Church.             It is remarked by one who was intimately acquainted with his situation and character previous to his embarkation for Africa,  that his Father was a pious and much respected member of the Baptist Church--and his Mother, though she made no public profession of religion, died, giving evidence that she had relied for salvation upon the Son of God. He was their only child, and though he had no early instruction from books, the admonitions and prayers of his illiterate parents may have laid the foundations for his future usefulness.              A strong desire to be able to read, was excited in his mind, by a sermon to which he attended soon after his conversion, and which related to our Lord's interview with Nicodemus; and having obtained a Testament, he commenced learning his letters, by trying to read the chapter in which this interview is recorded. He received some instruction, though he never attended a regular school. Such, however, were his diligence and perseverance, that he overcame all obstacles and acquired not only the art of reading, but of writing also. Shortly after the death of his first wife in 1813, he ransomed himself and two children for $850, a sum which he had obtained by his singular ability and fidelity in managing the concerns of the tobacco warehouse. Of the real     
   four younger than myself, one boy and three girls. But to account for my age is beyond the reach of my power. I was early fond of music, with an extraordinary appetite for singing lively times, for which I was a little remarkable.  In the course of a few years after  my birth, from the sterility of his land, my old master assumed the notion to move into Chatham,  a more fertile and fresh part of country recently settled, and whose waters were far more healthy and agreeable. I here become  a cow-boy, which I followed for perhaps ten years in succession, or more. In the course  of this disagreeable occupation, I became fond of hearing people read; but being nothing but a poor cow-boy, I had but little or no thought of ever being able to read or spell one word or sentence in any book whatever. My mother  discovered my anxiety for books, and strove  to encourage my plan; but she, having left her  husband behind, was so hard run to make a little shift for herself, that she could give me no assistance in that case.  At length I took resolution to learn the alphabet at all events; and lighting by chance at times with some opportunities of being in the presence of school children, I learnt the letters by heart; and fortunately afterwards got hold  of some        old parts of spelling books abounding with these elements, which I learnt with but little difficulty.  And by this time, my brother was deeply excited by the assiduity which he discovered  in me, to learn himself; and some of  his partial friends strove to put him before me,  and I in a stump now, and a sorry instrument  to work with at that. But still my brother  never could keep time with me. He was indeed  an ostentatious youth, and of a far more  attractive person than myself, more forward  in manly show and early became fond of popularity  to an astonishing degree for one of  his age and capacity. He strove hard on the wing of ambition to soar above me, and could write a respectable fist before I could form the first letter with a pen, or barely knew the use of a goose-quill. And I must say that he was quite a remarkable youth, as studious as a judge, but much too full of vain lounging among the fair sex.          But to return to the earlier spring of my progress. Though blundering, I became a  far better reader than he; but we were indeed both remarkable for boys of color, and hard raising. On well nigh every Sabbath during the year, did I retire away in the summer season  to some shady and lonely recess, when I        could stammer over the dim and promiscuous syllables in my old black and tattered spelling book, sometimes a piece of one, and then of another; nor would I scarcely spare the time  to return to my ordinary meals, being so truly engaged with my book. And by close application  to my book at night, my visage became  considerally emaciated by extreme perspiration,  having no lucubratory aparatus, no candle,  no lamp, nor even light-wood, being chiefly raised in oaky woods. Hence I had  to sit sweating and smoking over my incompetent  bark or brush light, almost exhausted  by the heat of the fire, and almost suffocated  with smoke; consequently from Monday  morning I anticipated with joy the approach  of the next Sabbath, that I might again retire  to the pleasant umbrage of the woods, whither  I was used to dwell or spend the most of  the day with ceaseless investigation over my  book. A number strove to dissuade me from  my plan, and had the presumption to tell  me that I was a vain fool to attempt learning  to read with as little chance as I had. Playboys  importunately insisted on my abandoning  my foolish theory, and go with them on  streams, desport, and sacrifice the day in athletic  folly, or alibatic levity. Nevertheless        did I persevere with an indefatigable resolution,  at the risk of success. But ah! the oppositions  with which I contended are too tedious  to relate, but not too formidable to surmount;  and I verily believe that those obstacles  had an auspicious tendency to waft me,  as on pacific gales, above the storms of envy  and the calumniating scourge of emulation,  from which literary imagination often sinks  beneath its dignity, and instruction languishes  at the shrine of vanity. I reached the threatening  heights of literature, and braved in a  manner the clouds of disgust which reared in  thunders under my feet. This brings to mind  the verse of an author on the adventurous seaman.              The wandering sailor ploughs the main,           A competence in life to gain;           The threatening waves around him foam,           'Till flattering fancy wafts him home.                 For the overthrow and  downfal of my scheme had been repeatedly threatened. But with  defiance I accomplished the arduous task of  spelling (for thus it was with me,) having no  facilitating assistance. From this I entered into reading lessons with triumph. I became very fond of reading parts of the New Testament,         such as  I  could pick up as they lay  about at random; but I soon became more fond of reading verses, Wesley's old hymns, and other peices of poetry from various authors.  I became found of it to that degree,  that whenever I chanced to light on a piece of paper, so common to be lying about, I would pick it up in order to examine it whether it  was written in that curious style or not. If  it was not, unless some remarkable prose, I  threw it aside; and if it was, I as carefully preserved  it as I would a piece of money. At  length I began to wonder whether it was possible  that I ever could be so fortunate as to  compose in that manner. I fell to work in  my head, and composed several undigested  pieces, which I retained in my mind, for I knew nothing about writing with a pen, also  without the least grammatical knowledge, a  few lines of which I yet retain.  I will give  you the following specimen. On one very  calm Sabbath morning, a while before the  time of preaching, I undertook to compose a  divine hymn, being under some serious impression  of mind:              Rise up, my soul and let us go           Up to the gospel feast;     
    you to death.   Of course, when the slaves were accused  falsely, as in this case, they were not allowed  to make any reply  -  they just had to endure in silence  whatever was said.    EFFORTS TO LEARN TO READ AND WRITE.             Thomas, the coachman, and I were fast friends.  We used to get together every time we had a chance and  talk about freedom.  Oh!  Tom would say,  if I  could only write.  I remember when Tom first began  to take lessons at night from some plasterers, workmen  of the neighborhood. They saw that he was so  anxious to learn that they promised to teach him  every evening if he would slip out to their house. I,  too, was eager to learn to read and write, but did not  have the opportunity which Tom had of getting out  at night. I had to sleep in the house where the folks  were, and could not go out without being observed,  while Tom had quarters in another part of the establishment,  and could slip out unobserved. Tom,  however, consoled me by saying that he would teach  me as soon as he knew how. So Tom one night put  a copy of some figures on the side of the barn for me  to practice from. I took the chalk and imitated him  as near as I could, but my work was poor beside his,          as he had been learning for some months, and could  make the figures quite well and write a little. Still I  kept trying. Tom encouraging me and telling me  that I would learn in time.  Just keep trying,   said he. When this first lesson was over, I forgot to  rub out the marks on the barn, and the next morning  when Old Master Jack, who happened to be at our  home just at that time, went out there and saw the  copy and my imitation of it, he at once raised great  excitement by calling attention to the rude characters  and wanting to know who had done that. I was  afraid to own that I had done it; but old Master Jack  somehow surmised that it was Tom or I, for he said  to Boss:   Edmund, you must watch those fellows,  Louis and Thomas, if you don't they will get spoilt  -   spoilt. They are pretty close to town here  -  here.  Tom and I laughed over this a good deal and how  easily we slipped out of it, but concluded not to stop  trying to learn all we could. Tom always said:   Lou, I am going to be a free man yet, then we will  need some education; no, let us never stop trying to  learn.  Tom was a Virginian, as I was, and was sold  from his parents when a mere lad.  Boss used to  write to his parents (owners) occasionally, that his         people might hear from him. The letters were to his  mother, but sent in care of the white folks. Tom  had progressed very fast in his secret studies, and  could write enough to frame a letter. It seems it had  been over a year since Boss had written for him, but  nothing was said until one morning I heard Boss telling  Tom to come to the barn to be whipped. He  showed Tom three letters which he had written to his  mother, and this so startled him that he said nothing.  I listened breathlessly to each word Boss said:   Where did you learn to write?  asked he,  and  when did you learn? How long have you been writing  to your mother?  At that moment he produced  the three letters which Tom had written. Boss, it  seems, had mistrusted something, and spoke to the  postmaster, telling him to stop any letters which Tom  might mail for Virginia to his mother. The postmaster  did as directed, for slaves had no rights which  postmasters were bound to respect; hence, the letters  fell into the master's hands instead of going to their  destination. Tom, not hearing from his first letter,  wrote a second, then a third, never dreaming that  they had been intercepted. Boss raged and Tom was  severely whipped. After this nothing Tom did         pleased any of the family  -  it was a continual pick on  him. Everything was wrong with both of us, for  they were equally hard on me. They mistrusted, I  think, that I could write; yet I could not find out just  what they did think.    TOM STRIKES FOR LIBERTY AND GAINS IT.             Tom stayed only a few weeks after this. He said  to me, one morning:   Lou, I am going away. If I  can get a boat to-night that is starting off, why, I am  gone from this place.  I was sad to see him go, for  he was like a brother to me  -  he was my companion  and friend. He went, and was just in time to catch  the boat at the Memphis dock. He succeeded in  getting on, and made an application to the captain to  work on the boat. The captain did not hesitate to  employ him, as it was common for slaves to be permitted  to hire themselves out for wages which they  were required to return, in whole or in part, to their  masters. Of course all such slaves carried a written  pass to this effect. Tom was shrewd; and, having  learned to write fairly well, he wrote himself a pass,  which was of the usual kind, stating his name, to  whom he belonged, and that he was privileged to  hire himself out wherever he could, coming and going        
     failed, it has not been for want of interest in your welfare. Do not weep for me; but prepare for the new duties that lie before you. I leave you all free. May we meet in a better world.  Her liberated slaves were sent away, with funds to establish them comfortably. The colored people will long bless the memory of that truly Christian woman. Soon after her death her husband preached his farewell sermon, and many tears were shed at his departure.           Several years after, he passed through our town and preached to his former congregation. In his afternoon sermon he addressed the colored people.  My friends,  said he,  it affords me great happiness to have an opportunity of speaking to you again. For two years I have been striving to do something for the colored people of my own parish; but nothing is yet accomplished. I have not even preached a sermon to them. Try to live according to the word of God, my friends. Your skin is darker than mine; but God judges men by their hearts, not by the color of their skins.  This was strange doctrine from a southern pulpit. It was very offensive to slaveholders. They said he and his wife had made fools of their slaves, and that he preached like a fool to the negroes.           I knew an old black man, whose piety and childlike trust in God were beautiful to witness. At fifty-three years old he joined the Baptist church. He had a most earnest desire to learn to read. He thought he should know how to serve God better if he could only read the Bible. He came to me, and begged me to teach him. He said he could not pay me, for he had           no money, but he would bring me nice fruit when the season for it came. I asked him if he didn't know it was contrary to law; and that slaves were whipped and imprisoned for teaching each other to read. This brought the tears into his eyes.  Don't be troubled uncle Fred,  said I.  I have no thoughts of refusing to teach you. I only told you of the law, that you might know the danger, and be on your guard.  He thought he could plan to come three times a week without its being suspected. I selected a quiet nook, where no intruder was likely to penetrate, and there I taught him his A, B, and C. Considering his age, his progress was astonishing. As soon as he could spell in two syllables he wanted to spell out words in the Bible. The happy smile that illuminated his face put joy into my heart. After spelling out a few words, he paused, and said,  Honey, it 'pears when I can read dis good book I shall be nearer to God. White man is got all de sense. He can larn easy. It ain't easy for ole black man like me. I only wants to read dis book, dat I may know how to live, den I hab no fear 'bout dying.            I tried to encourage him by speaking of the rapid progress he had made.  Hab patience, child,  he replied.  I larns slow.            I had no need of patience. His gratitude, and the happiness I imparted, were more than a recompense for all my trouble.           At the end of six months he had read through the New Testament, and could find any text in it. One day, when he had recited unusually well, I said,            Uncle Fred, how do you manage to get your lessons so well?             Lord bress you, chile,  he replied.  You nebber gibs me a lesson dat I don't pray to God to help me to understan' what I spells and what I reads. And he   does   help me, chile. Bress his holy name!            There are thousands, who, like good uncle Fred, are thirsting for the water of life; but the law forbids it, and the churches withhold it. They send the Bible to heathen abroad, and neglect the heathen at home. I am glad that missionaries go out to the dark corners of the earth; but I ask them not to overlook the dark corners at home. Talk to American slaveholders as you talk to savages in Africa. Tell   them   it is wrong to traffic in men. Tell them it is sinful to sell their own children, and atrocious to violate their own daughters. Tell them that all men are brethren, and that man has no right to shut out the light of knowledge from his brother. Tell them they are answerable to God for sealing up the Fountain of Life from souls that are thirsting for it.           There are men who would gladly undertake such missionary work as this; but, alas! their number is small. They are hated by the south, and would be driven from its soil, or dragged to prison to die, as others have been before them. The field is ripe for the harvest, and awaits the reapers. Perhaps the great grandchildren of uncle Fred may have freely imparted to them the divine treasures, which he sought by stealth, at the risk of the prison and the scourge.           Are doctors of divinity blind, or are they            hypocrites? I suppose some are the one, and some the other; but I think if they felt the interest in the poor and the lowly, that they ought to feel, they would not be so   easily   blinded. A clergyman who goes to the south, for the first time, has usually some feeling, however vague, that slavery is wrong. The slaveholder suspects this, and plays his game accordingly. He makes himself as agreeable as possible; talks on theology, and other kindred topics. The reverend gentleman is asked to invoke a blessing on a table loaded with luxuries. After dinner he walks round the premises, and sees the beautiful groves and flowering vines, and the comfortable huts of favored household slaves. The southerner invites him to talk with these slaves. He asks them if they want to be free, and they say,  O, no, massa.  This is sufficient to satisfy him. He comes home to publish a  South-Side View of Slavery,  and to complain of the exaggerations of abolitionists. He assures people that he has been to the south, and seen slavery for himself; that it is a beautiful  patriarchal institution;  that the slaves don't want their freedom; that they have hallelujah meetings, and other religious privileges.           What does   he   know of the half-starved wretches toiling from dawn till dark on the plantations? of mothers shrieking for their children, torn from their arms by slave traders? of young girls dragged down into moral filth? of pools of blood around the whipping post? of hounds trained to tear human flesh? of men screwed into cotton gins to die? The slaveholder showed him none of these things, and the slaves dared not tell of them if he had asked them.                    There is a great difference between Christianity and religion at the south. If a man goes to the communion table, and pays money into the treasury of the church, no matter if it be the price of blood, he is called religious. If a pastor has offspring by a woman not his wife, the church dismiss him, if she is a white woman; but if she is colored, it does not hinder his continuing to be their good shepherd.           When I was told that Dr. Flint had joined the Episcopal church, I was much surprised. I supposed that religion had a purifying effect on the character of men; but the worst persecutions I endured from him were after he was a communicant. The conversation of the doctor, the day after he had been confirmed, certainly gave   me   no indication that he had  renounced the devil and all his works.  In answer to some of his usual talk, I reminded him that he had just joined the church.  Yes, Linda,  said he.  It was proper for me to do so. I am getting in years, and my position in society requires it, and it puts an end to all the damned slang. You would do well to join the church, too, Linda.             There are sinners enough in it already,  rejoined I.  If I could be allowed to live like a Christian, I should be glad.             You can do what I require; and if you are faithful to me, you will be as virtuous as my wife,  he replied.           I answered that the Bible didn't say so.           His voice became hoarse with rage.  How dare you preach to me about your infernal Bible!  he      
   Master administered such punishment as he thought best. The punishment was a certain number of lashes from the whip for the first offence and more if the offence was repeated, with the addition of an iron weight tied to their backs for a number of days or weeks according to the Master's pleasure, these weights to be carried during the day while they were at work.           The year of which we are writing, about two hundred slaves were gathered on the stock farm, and in the fall most of them were marched off to the several slave markets in the same manner as before described, fastened to a long chain with the women who could walk following, and the women and children not able to walk in wagons. Of the two hundred, 170 were taken, leaving thirty to run the farm and do the winter work. This lot was taken to Bardstown, thence to Louisville, where they were put aboard of boats rigged with stalls similar to horse stalls into which the slaves were placed and chained until they reached Vicksburg or other places where markets were held.           On this trip Rosa accompanied the Master, and his wife was left on the farm to attend to matters there. His wife was a devout Catholic, and while Master was gone she used to gather the slaves remaining, each morning in her dining room and teach them prayers and some of the younger ones she taught to read. When the Master returned in the spring and learned what she had been doing he was very angry. He had always told his  slaves that he was their Lord and Master, and now informed them his wife should not have told them of any other Lord. From Rosa we learned that he lectured his wife for her conduct about as follows:  If you teach them to pray and read they may think they are human beings and we will not be able to keep them as slaves; the more ignorant we        keep them about such things the better slaves they are. The worst slaves we have are those who know the most, they are the ones we have to punish to keep them down. We have here from twenty to two hundred slaves each year, and if they should know as much as we do, where would we be? They would murder us in spite of the law. After this, my dear wife, you must never teach a negro the Lord's prayer, or any other prayer.            After the above there was no more gathering for prayers, and the little prayer book she had distributed among us and the little primers she had given were taken from us by Rosa, she saying:  The Master says you do not need them.  Thus we soon lost what little we had learned, except, for some reason, the Lord's prayer, so simple and yet so full of meaning and comfort, was quite generally remembered. It has always seemed to me that there was some Divine help in this. That little prayer increased my wonder why we should be the slaves of the whites, and especially did I wonder in my own case when I thought of the fact that my mother was from the island of Madagascar and her people were never slaves. Why then should I be one?           After Master's lecture to his wife she had no more to do with us and the care of the slaves was turned over to Rosa who was a slave herself, and the Sunday following, Master had us all seated on the ground in the yard and lectured us as follows:            You must not think hard of me for telling you the truth about yourselves and the Whites. The great God above has made you for the benefit of the Whiteman, who is your law maker and law giver. Whenever you disobey his commands you must expect punishment. Your duty is in all cases to never raise your     
   and has run away from the dark misery of bondage.  And now, when he calls upon his Father in Heaven to  pour out rich blessings on the few friends who have  aided him, then David Cogdell is remembered with fond  and fervent affection.  David was one of the few who  always regarded the feelings and happiness of others as  earnestly as his own; who find their own happiness in  making the unfortunate happy by sympathy and kindness,  and who would suffer any loss rather than do injustice  to the poor and defenceless. I often wondered  how there could be such a difference in the character of  two men, as there was between that of my master and  my friend and benefactor, David Cogdell. And I often  wished that I might pass into the hands of such a man  as he was. But his kindness and generosity to the poor  slaves was very offensive to my master, and to other  slaveholders; and so, at length, Mr. Jones turned him  off, though he was compelled to acknowledge, at the  same time, that he was the most trustworthy and valuable  assistant he ever had in his store.          After my master dismissed Mr. C., he tried to get  along with me alone in the store. He kept the books  and waited upon the most genteel of his customers,  leaving me to do the rest of the work. This went on  six months, when he declared that he could not bear  this confinement any longer; and so he got a white boy  to come and enter as clerk, to stay till he was of age.  James Dixon was a poor boy about my own age, and  when he came into the store, could hardly read or  write. He was accordingly engaged a part of each day  with his books and writing. I saw him studying, and  asked him to let me see his book. When he felt in a  good humor, James was very kind and obliging. The  great trouble with him was, that his fits of ill-humor  were much more frequent than his times of good feeling.  It happened, however, that he was on good terms  with himself when I asked him to show me his book, and  so he let me take it and look at it, and he answered  very kindly many questions which I asked him about       books and schools and learning. He told me that he  was trying to get learning enough to fit him to do a good business for himself after he should get through  with Mr. Jones. He told me that a man who had  learning would always find friends, and get along very  well in the world without having to work hard, while  those who had no learning would have no friends and  be compelled to work very hard for a poor living all  their days. This was all new to me, and furnished me  topics for wondering thought for days afterwards. The  result of my meditations was, that an intense burning  desire to learn to read and write took possession of my  mind, occupying me wholly in waking hours, and stirring  up earnest thoughts in my soul even when I slept.  The question which then took hold of my whole consciousness  was, How can I get a book to begin? James  told me that a spelling-book was the first one necessary  in getting learning. So I contrived how I might obtain  a spelling-book. At length, after much study, I hit  upon this plan: I cleaned the boots of a Mr. David  Smith, Jr., who carried on the printer's business in Wilmington, and  edited the Cape Fear Recorder. He had  always appeared to me a very kind man. I thought I  would get him to aid me in procuring a spelling-book.  So I went one morning, with a beating heart, into his  office, and asked him to sell me a spelling-book. He  looked at me in silence and with close attention for some  time, and asked me what I wanted. I told him I wanted  to learn to read. He shook his head, and replied,  No,  Thomas, it would not answer for me to sell you a book  to learn out of; you will only get yourself into trouble  if you attempt it; and I advise you to get that foolish  notion out of your head as quickly as you can.           David's brother, Peter  Smith, kept a book and stationery  store under the printing-office, and I next applied  to him for a book, determined to persevere till I  obtained this coveted treasure. He asked me the same  question that his brother David had done, and with the  same searching, suspicious look. By my previous repulse               I had discovered that I could not get a spelling-book if I told what I wanted to do with it, and so I told  a lie, in order to get it. I answered, that I wanted it  for a white boy, naming one that lived at my master's,  and that he had given me the money to get it with, and  had asked me to call at the store and buy it. The book  was then handed out to me, the money taken in return,  and I left, feeling very rich with my long-desired treasure.  I got out of the store, and, looking around to see  that no one observed me, I hid my book in my bosom,  and hurried on to my work, conscious that a new era  in my life was opening upon me through the possession  of this book. That counsciousness at once awakened  new thoughts, purposes, and new hopes, a new life, in  fact, in my experience. My mind was excited. The  words spoken by James Dixon of the great advantages  of learning, made me intensely anxious to learn. I was  a slave; and I knew that the whole community was in  league to keep the poor slave in ignorance and chains.  Yet I longed to be free, and to be able to move the  minds of other men by my thoughts. It seemed to me  now, that, if I could learn to read and write, this learning  might -- nay, I really thought it would, point out to  me the way to freedom, influence, and real, secure happiness.  So I hurried on to my master's store, and,  watching my opportunity to do it safe from curious  eyes, I hid my book with the utmost care, under some  liquor barrels in the smoke house. The first opportunity  I improved to examine my book. I looked it over  with the most intent eagerness, turned over its leaves,  and tried to discover what the new and strange characters  which I saw in its pages might mean. But I found it a vain endeavor. I could understand a picture, and  from it make out a story of immediate interest to my  mind. But I could not associate any thought or fact  with these crooked letters with which my primer was  filled. So the next day I sought a favorable moment,  and asked James to tell me where a scholar must begin  in order to learn to read, and how. He laughed at my          ignorance, and taking his spelling-book, showed me the  alphabet in large and small letters on the same page. I  asked him the name of the first letter, pointing it out;  he told me A; so of the next, and so on through the  alphabet. I managed to remember A and B, and I  studied and looked out the same letters in many other  parts of the book. And so I fixed in a tenacious memory  the names of the first two letters of the alphabet.  But I found I could not get on without help, and so I  applied to James again to show me the letters and tell  me their names. This time he suspected me of trying  to learn to read myself, and he plied me with questions  till he ascertained that I was, in good earnest, entering  upon an effort to get knowledge. At this discovery he  manifested a good deal of indignation. He told me, in  scorn, that it was not for such as  me  to try to improve,  that  I  was a  slave,  and that it was not proper for   me  to learn to read. He threatened to tell my master, and at  length, by his hard language, my anger was fully  aroused, and I answered taunt with taunt. He called me  a poor, miserable nigger; and I called him a poor, ignorant  white servant boy. While we were engaged in  loud and angry words, of mutual defiance and scorn,  my master came into the store. Mr. Jones had never  given me a whipping since the time I have already described,  during my first year of toil, want and suffering  in his service. But he now caught me in the unpardonable  offence of giving saucy language to a white  boy, and one, too, who was in his employ. Without  stopping to make any inquiries, he took down the cow-hide,  and gave me a severe whipping. He told me  never talk back to a white man on pain of flogging.  I suppose this law or custom is universal at the south.  And I suppose it is thought necessary to enforce this  habit of obsequious submission on the part of the colored  people to the whites, in order to maintain their supremacy  over the poor, outraged slaves.          I will mention, in this connection, as illustrative of  this cruel custom, an incident which I saw just before I 	       ran away from my chains. A little colored boy was  carrying along through Wilmington a basket of food.  His name was Ben, and he belonged to Mrs. Runkin, a  widow lady. A little mischievous white boy, just about  Ben's age and size, met him, and purposely overturned  the little fellow's basket, and scattered his load in the  mud. Ben, in return for this wanton act, called him  some hard name, when the white boy clinched him to  throw him down with the scattered fragments upon his  basket in the mud. Ben resisted, and threw down the  white boy, proving to be the stronger of the two. Tom  Myers, a young lawyer of Wilmington, saw the contest,  and immediately rushing out, seized little Ben and  dragged him into the store opposite the place of battle.  He sent out to a saddler's shop, procured a cowhide,  and gave the little fellow a tremendous flogging, for the  daring crime of resisting a white boy who had wantonly  invaded his rights. Is it any wonder that the spirit  of self-respect of the poor ignorant slave is broken down  by such treatment of unsparing and persevering cruelty?          I was now repulsed by James, so that I could hope  for no assistance from him in learning to read. But I  could not go on alone. I must get some one to aid me  in starting, or give up the effort to learn. This I could  not bear to do. I longed to be able to read, and so I  cast about me to see what I could do next. I thought  of a kind boy at the bake-house, near my own age. I  thought he would help me, and so I went to him, showed  my book, and asked him to teach me the letters. He  told their names, and went over the whole alphabet with  me three times. By this assistance I learned a few more  of the letters, so that I could remember them afterwards  when I sat down alone and tried to call them  over. I could now pick out and name five or six of the  letters in any part of the book. I felt then that I was getting along, and the consciousness that I was making  progress, though slow and painful, was joy and hope to my sorrowing heart, such as I never felt before. I        could not with safety go to the bake-house, as there I  was exposed to detection by the sudden entrance of customers  or idlers. I wanted to get a teacher who would  give me a little aid each day, and now I set about securing  this object. As kind Providence would have it, I  easily succeeded, and on this wise: A little boy, Hiram  Bricket, ten years old, or about that age, came along by the store one day, on his way home from school,  while my master was gone home to dinner, and James was in the front part of the store. I beckoned to Hiram to come round to the back door; and with him I  made a bargain to meet me each day at noon, when I  was allowed a little while to get my dinner, and to give  me instruction in reading. I was to give him six cents a  week. I met him the next day at his father's stable,  the place agreed upon for our daily meeting; and, going  into one of the stalls, the noble little Hiram gave  me a thorough lesson in the alphabet. I learned it  nearly all at that time, with what study I could give it  by stealth during the day and night. And then again  I felt lifted up and happy.          I was permitted to enjoy these advantages, however,  but a short time. A black boy, belonging to Hiram's father, one day discovered our meeting and what we  were doing. He told his master of it, and Hiram was  at once forbidden this employment. I had then got  along so that I was reading and spelling in words of  two syllables. My noble little teacher was very patient  and faithful with me, and my days were passing away  in very great happiness under the consciousness that I was learning to read. I felt at night, as I went to my  rest, that I was really beginning to be a  man,  preparing  myself for a condition in life better and higher, and  happier than could belong to the ignorant  slave.  And  in this blessed feeling I found, waking and sleeping, a most precious happiness.          After I was deprived of my kind little teacher, I  plodded on the best way I could myself, and in this way  I got into words of five syllables. I got some little time        to study by daylight in the morning, before any of my  master's family had risen. I got a moment's opportunity  at noon, and sometimes at night. During the day  I was in the back store a good deal, and whenever I  thought I could have five minutes to myself, I would  take my book and try to learn a little in reading and  spelling. If I heard James, or master Jones, or any  customer coming in, I would drop my book among the  barrels, and pretend to be very busy shovelling the salt  or doing some other work. Several times I came very  near being detected. My master suspected something,  because I was so still in the back room, and a number  of times he came very slily to see what I was about.  But at such times I was always so fortunate as to hear  his tread or see his shadow on the wall in time to hide  away my book.          When I had got along to words of five syllables, I  went to see a colored friend, Ned Cowan, whom I knew  I could trust. I told him I was trying to learn to read,  and asked him to help me a little. He said he did not  dare to give me any instruction, but he heard me read  a few words, and then told me I should learn if I would  only persevere as nobly as I had done thus far. I told  him  how  I had got along, and what difficulties I had  met with. He encouraged me, and spoke very kindly  of my efforts to improve my condition by getting learning.  He told me I had got along far enough to get another  book, in which I could learn to write the letters,  as well as to read. He told me where and how to procure  this book. I followed his directions, and obtained  another spelling-book at Worcester's store, in Wilmington. Jacob showed me a little about writing. He set  me a copy, first of straight marks. I now got me a  box which I could hide under my bed, some ink, pens,  and a bit of candle. So, when I went to bed, I pulled  my box out from under my cot, turned it up on end,  and began my first attempt at writing. I worked away  till my candle was burned out, and then laid down to  sleep. Jacob next set me a copy which he called pot       hooks; then, the letters of the alphabet. These letters  were also in my new spelling-book, and according to  Jacob's directions, I set them before me for a copy, and  wrote on these exercises till I could form all the letters  and call them by name. One evening I wrote out my  name in large letters --  THOMAS JONES.  This I  carried to Jacob, in a great excitement of happiness,  and he warmly commended me for my perseverance and  diligence.          About this time, I was at the store early one morning,  and, thinking I was safe from all danger for a few  minutes, had seated myself in the back store, on one of  the barrels, to study in my precious spelling-book.  While I was absorbed in this happy enterprise, my master  came in, much earlier than usual, and I did not hear him. He came directly into the back store. I saw his  shadow on the wall, just in time to throw my book over  in among the barrels, before he could see what it was,  although he saw that I had thrown something quickly  away. His suspicion was aroused. He said that I had  been stealing something out of the store, and fiercely  ordered me to get what I threw away just as he was  coming in at the door. Without a moment's hesitation,  I determined to save my precious book and my future  opportunities to learn out of it. I knew if my book  was discovered that all was lost, and I felt prepared for  any hazard or suffering rather than give up my book  and my hopes of improvement. So I replied at once  to his questions, that I had not thrown anything away;  that I had not stolen anything from the store; that I  did not have anything in my hands which I could throw  away when he came in. My master declared in a high  passion, that I was lying, and ordered me to begin and  roll away the barrels. This I did; but managed to  keep the book slipping along so that he could not see  it, as he stood in the door-way. He charged me again  with stealing and throwing something away, and I  again denied the charge. In a great rage, he got down  his long, heavy cow-hide, and ordered me to strip off        my jacket and shirt, saying, with an oath,  I will make  you tell me what it was you had when I came.  I  stripped myself, and came forward, according to his directions,  at the same time denying his charge with great  earnestness of tone, and look, and manner. He cut me  on my naked back, perhaps thirty times, with great severity,  making the blood flow freely. He then stopped,  and asked me what I had thrown away as he came in.  I answered again that I had thrown nothing away. He  swore terribly; said he was certain I was lying, and  declared he would kill me if I did not tell him the truth.  He whipped me the second time with greater severity,  and at greater length than before. He then repeated  his question, and I answered again as before. I was  determined to die, if I could possibly bear the pain,  rather than give up my dear book. He whipped me  the third time, with the same result as before, and then  seizing hold of my shoulders, turned me round as  though he would inflict on my quivering flesh still another  scourging, but he saw the deep gashes he had already  made, and the blood already flowing under his  cruel infliction; and his stern purpose failed him. He  said,  Why, Tom, I didn't think I had cut you so bad,  and saying that, he stopped, and told me to put on my  shirt again. I did as he bade me, although my coarse  shirt touching my raw back put me to a cruel pain.  He then went out, and I got my book and hid it safely  away before he came in again. When I went to the  house, my wounds had dried, and I was in an agony of  pain. My mistress told the servant girl, Rachel, to help  me off with my shirt, and to wash my wounds for me,  and put on to them some sweet oil. The shirt was dried  to my back so that it could not be got off without tearing  off some of the skin with it. The pain, upon doing  this, was greater even than I had endured from my  cruel whipping. After Rachel had got my shirt off,  my mistress asked me what I had done for which my  master had whipped me so severely. I told her he had  accused me of stealing when I had not, and then had whipped me to make me own it.                 While Rachel was putting on the sweet oil my master  came in, and I could hear mistress scolding him for  giving me such an inhuman beating, when I had done  nothing. He said in reply, that Tom was an obstinate  liar, and that was the reason why he had whipped me.          But I got well of my mangled back, and my book  was still left. This was my best, my constant friend.  With great eagerness, I snatched every moment I  could get, morning, noon and night, for study. I had  begun to read; and, oh, how I loved to study, and to  dwell on the thoughts which I gained from reading.  About this time, I read a piece in my book about God.  It said that  God, who sees and knows all our thoughts,  loves the good and makes them happy; while he is  angry with the bad, and will punish them for all their  sins.  This made me feel very unhappy, because I was  sure I was not good in the sight of God. I thought  about this, and could'nt get it out of my mind a single  hour. So I went to James Galley, a colored man, who  exhorted the slaves sometimes on Sunday, and told him  my trouble, asking,  what shall I do?  He told me  about Jesus, and told me I must pray the Lord to forgive  me and help me to be good and happy. So I  went home, and went down cellar and prayed, but I  found no relief, no comfort for my unhappy mind. I  felt so bad that I could not study my book. My master  saw that I looked very unhappy, and he asked me  what ailed me. I did not dare  now  to tell a lie, for I  wanted to be good, that I might be happy. So I told  my master just how it was with me; and then he swore  terribly at me, and said he would whip me if I did not  give over praying. He said there was no heaven and  no hell, and that Christians were all hypocrites, and  that there was nothing after this life, and that he would  not permit me to go moping round, praying and going  to the meetings. I told him I could not help praying,  and then he cursed me in a great passion, and declared  he would whip me if he knew of my going on any more  in that foolish way. The next night I was to a meeting,        
     members of families by sale--but not of mine. With me and my house, the tenderer tendrils of the heart still clung to where the vine had entwined; pleasant was its shade and delicious our fruits to our taste, though we knew, and what is more, we  felt  that we were slaves. But all around I could see where the vine had been torn down, and its bleeding branches told of vanished joys, and of new wrought sorrows, such as, slave though I was, had never entered into my practical experience.            I had never been permitted to learn to read; but I used to attend church, and there I received instruction which I trust was of some benefit to me.  I trusted, too, that I had experienced the renewing influences of the gospel; and after obtaining from my mistress a written  permit  (a thing  always  required in such a case,) I had been baptised and received into fellowship with the Baptist denomination.  So that in religious matters, I had been indulged in the exercise of my own conscience--a favor not always granted to slaves.  Indeed I, with others, was often told by the minister how good God was in bringing us over to this country from dark and benighted Africa, and permitting us to listen to the sound of the gospel. To me, God also granted temporal freedom, which man without God's consent, had stolen away.            I often heard select portions of the scriptures     
   and get through sometimes by the middle of the week, and would then spend the remainder of the week in roving and roaming up and down the creek, fishing, etc. Our master was not hard on us, and allowed us generally to do as we pleased after his own work was done, and we enjoyed the privilege granted to us. I was a cow-boy in the meantime, and for six successive years I, with my mother, attended to the dairy.           My mother was very severe on me. She used to whip me nearly every night for the misdemeanors of the day. She would wait till I had undressed, and then attended to her loving boy as she used to call me.           Mothers were necessarily compelled to be severe on their children to keep them from talking too much. Many a poor mother has been whipped nearly to death on account of their children telling the white children things, who would then go and tell their mothers or fathers. My mother always told me what she was going to whip me for before commencing, and would talk to me while she was whipping me. I only got one whipping from father, and that I richly deserved. I would blush to tell the cause of that whipping in this book, but it was a good one. He was always my friend when I thought trouble was in the air; he was my only refuge; when he failed to plead for me my hopes fled.           Very early in life I took up the idea that I wanted to learn to read and write. I was convinced that there        would be something for me to do in the future that I could not accomplish by remaining in ignorance. I had heard so much about freedom, and of the colored people running off and going to Canada, that my mind was busy with this subject even in my young days. I sought the aid of the white boys, who did all they could in teaching me. They did not know that it was dangerous for a slave to read and write. I availed myself of every opportunity, daily I carried my book in my pocket, and every chance that offered would be learning my A, B, C's. Soon I learned to read. After this the white people would send me daily to the post-office, at Simpsonville, Ky., a distance of two miles, when I would read the address of the letters; I also would read the newspapers the best I could. There was an old colored man on the place by the name of Ham Graves, who opened a night school, beginning at 10 o'clock at night. I attended his school one year and learned how to write my name and read writing. On every gate - post around the stable, as on the plowhandles, you could see where I had been trying to write. Of course, I did not know the danger of it, and that fools', names like fools' faces are always seen in public places.           I am unable to tell the day or year when I became a Christian, but it was about the year 1851. Well do I remember the time when I went to a Methodist class     
      pair shoes, one pair stockings, one pair woolen pants, one coat, two pairs coarse tow linen pants, two shirts, and board, is the law of the State of Maryland allows a man, free or slave, black or white, who hires for one year.             My friends who may read this little work, will make due allowance when they see that I never possessed the advantage of one day's schooling in my life, and only commenced to learn my letters when nineteen years and eight months old.             At one time, when going to my work, I found a piece of a chapter of an old Bible, Genesis 25, concerning Isaac, Jacob, and Esau. At this time there was an old colored man working for my father. He, taking the piece of Bible, and read it to me; I do not remember ever hearing that much of the Bible read before. I told him I would like to learn to read; he told me to get a book and he would learn me, while he stayed with us. I bought a little           primer, and Sunday morning he commenced learning me my letters. By Monday morning I could say them all. He would give me lessons nights and Sabbath mornings. He said when he used to take his master's children to school, he would carry his book in his hat and get the children to give him a lesson in the interval of the school. He grew up to be a young man, experienced religion, and joined the M. E. church, and was authorized to preach among his colored brethren, free and slave, and was set free some time before he worked for my father.             After he left our house I was without a teacher, and there was an old man about seventy-five or eighty years old, a slaveholder, owned a small farm and one slave woman married to a slave belonging to another slaveholder. This woman was the mother of two small children. Her old master had five daughters, one son eighteen years of age, a family of ten           in number, to be supported from this little farm,--no one to work except this son and the slave woman, only as I would go and help them occasionally. By this the young man and I became very intimate, and I learned him the art of wrestling, boxing and fighting, and he learned me to read. After that I went to work on a rail road; then I taught boxing school, and learned to write. After that I went to St. George, Del., to work at a hotel. One day a white boy came to me and said that he was hungry; his father gambled away his money, and if I would give him and his little sister something to eat occasionally, he would come three nights in the week and set copies for me to write, and learn me to cypher. The landlady was very glad of the opportunity, and gave me the privilege of giving them as much as I pleased, and I used to take them in the kitchen and give them what they could eat, and fill their little basket to take home. He would           stay with me sometimes until 2 or 3 o'clock P. M., and learn me to cypher to the single rule of three.             I arrived at Hartford on the 15th of Nov., 1835. Since that time some of my good white friends have assisted me by referring me to good books, and giving good instruction, of which I have reason to believe some of them are in heaven, and others on earth doing good.             My mother's and father's theology, or the way we children were taught by our parents, neither of them could read; but as mother's master was a member of the M. E. church, and used to read the Bible to his slaves--not learn nor teach them to read, but read the Bible to them.             First, man is a compound being, possessing two natures, a soul and a body; the body is of the earth, and must die and return to the dust from whence it came; but the soul is immortal; that is, will never die, but will live forever     
              This day marks an epoch in the life of every child, to be remembered through all after-life.             As Lee and Mary left the front gate morning after morning with their satchels well filled with books,  and night after night they studied their lessons well,  all this could not fail to pass unnoticed by the bright  eye of William.            The question occurred to him:  Why am I not like  the white children, with my books going to school, and learning to read and write?              His youthful mind has not yet grasped the fact  that he is a slave, and that schools and books are  not for him.             As William realizes that he is somehow different  from the other children, he reasons within himself:   Why should Lee go to school and I be deprived of  this same privilege?  And as he meditates he  investigates with the same mathematical precision characteristic of his nature, and enters into a  personal examination of himself.             One day about this time, the children being at  school and his mistress out visiting, William enters  the house and surveys himself in the mirror, and as  he looks he says:  Yes, I'm white just like Lee;   but the more he ponders the further he gets from  the solution of the question, and as a last resort he  appeals to his mother.            One night when alone with her he asks:  Mammy,  why can't I go to school like Lee?             They were sitting by the fire, and she looked  steadily into the blaze as she replied:  Hush, child,  you are a slave's child, and there is no use talking  about schooling for you. Slave children can't go to      
      CHAPTER V.             The slaves were unlearned, for in slavery times it was considered a crime to teach a slave to read, and it was not very often that a colored person could be found who could either read or write. But what they lacked in book knowledge was sometimes made up to them in traditions. These traditions were many of them curious and unreasonable, but, nevertheless, were believed implicitly by the colored people, and often-times the white people were more or less believers in the traditions and superstitions of the colored people.             It was very common for the white people to have their children cared for by colored women, whom the children used to call mammie, and not infrequently     
    and some were kept on the plantation, where they remain, the victims of cruel slavery. Such bad reports were made respecting the free States, that they were afraid to come here, even to be free.       MY OWN HISTORY.              HAVING briefly given the history of the overseers, I will now give my own, and how I, a slave, learned to read and write. Edloe owned eighty-one slaves, and among them all, only myself could either read or write. When I was a child, my mother used to tell me to look to Jesus, and that he who protected the widow and fatherless would take care of me also. At that time, my ideas of Jesus were the same as those of the other slaves. I thought he would talk with me, if I wished it, and give me what I asked for. Being very sickly, my greatest wish was to live with Christ in heaven, and so I used to go into the woods and lie upon my back, and pray that he would come and take me to himself,--really expecting to see Him with my bodily eyes. I was then between ten and eleven years old, and I continued to look for Him until I began to feel very sorry that He would not come and talk with me; and then I felt that I was the worst little boy that ever lived, and that was the reason Jesus would not talk to me. I felt so about it, I wanted to die, and thought it would be just in God to kill me, and I prayed that he would kill me, for I did not want to live to sin against him any more. I felt so for many days and nights. At last, I gave myself up to the Lord, to do what he would with me, for I was a great sinner. I began to see the offended justice of God. O! my readers, the anguish of my heart! I thought the whole world was on me, and I must die and be lost. In the midst of my troubles, I felt         that if God would have mercy on me, I should never sin again. When I had come to this, I felt my guilt give way, and thought that I was a new being. Now, instead of looking with my real eyes to see my Savior, I felt him in me, and I was happy. The eyes of my mind were open, and I saw things as I never did before. With my mind's eye, I could see my Redeemer hanging upon the cross for me.             I wanted all the other slaves to see him thus, and feel as happy as I did. I used to talk to others, and tell them of the friend they would have in Jesus, and show them by my experience how I was brought to Christ, and felt his love within my heart,--and love it was, in God's adapting himself to my capacity.             After receiving this revelation from the Lord, I became impressed that I was called of God to preach to the other slaves. I labored under this impression for seven years, but then I could not read the Bible, and I thought I could never preach unless I learned to read the Bible, but I had no one to teach me how to read. A friend showed me the letters, and how to spell words of three letters. Then I continued, until I got so as to read the Bible,--the great book of God,--the source of all knowledge. It was my great desire to read easily this book. I thought it was written by the Almighty himself. I loved this book, and prayed over it and labored until I could read it. I used to go to the church to hear the white preacher. When I heard him read his text, I would read mine when I got borne. This is the way, my readers, I learned to read the Word of God when I was a slave. Thus did I labor eleven years under the impression that I was called to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ, the ever-blessed God.             Then I learned to write. Here I had no teaching; but I obtained a book with the writing alphabet in it. I copied the letters until I could write. I had no slate, so I used to         write on the ground. All by myself I learned the art of writing. Then I used to do my own letter-writing, and write my own pass. When the slave wants to go from one plantation to another, he must have a pass from the overseer. I could do my own writing unbeknown to the overseer, and carry my own pass.             My oldest brother's name was Benjamin. He was owned by C. H. Edloe, the same person who owned me. Benjamin was a very bright young man, and very active about his work. He was fond of laughing and frolicking with the young women on the plantation. This Lacy, the overseer, did not like; and therefore was always watching Benjamin, seeking an occasion to have him whipped. At one time, a pig had been found dead. The little pig could not tell why he was dead, and no one confessed a knowledge of his death; consequently, Lacy thought so great a calamity, so important a death, should be revenged. He advised Edloe to have every slave whipped. Edloe consented, expecting, probably, to prevent, by such cruelty, any other pig from dying a natural death. Lacy, the tender-hearted overseer, with a heart overflowing with sorrow at the great loss and sad bereavement of Edloe's plantation, took his rawhide, with a wire attached to the end of it, and gave each man twenty lashes on the bare back. O, monster! the blood was seen upon the side of the barn where these slaves were whipped for days and months. The wounds of these poor creatures prevented them from performing their daily tasks. They were, indeed, so cut up, that pieces came out of the backs of some of them, so that a child twelve or thirteen years old could lay his fist in the cruel place, My brother Benjamin was one of the slaves so savagely beaten. One morning, Lacy--perhaps thinking piggy's death not wholly avenged--proposed again to whip my brother; but Benjamin did not agree with him as to the necessity of such proceedings,     
   of Missouri when he was but a child. He was really the property of the young mistress, who refused to sell him, but kept him as chore boy in the big house, and the whole family loved him. This explains why they so readily bought us in at the auction.           At this time while he was yet young my father learned to read and write; although it was against the law for a slave to learn to read or write, he was thirsty for knowledge and stole what little education he had from his master's children. It happened on this wise; the boys were always spelling and repeating their lessons at home where they studied. He said he had a burning desire to learn to read. He would listen to them and would often steal their books, especially their speller, and have them tell him what these or those letters would spell. He studied in the field, or in the old log cabin, at night by the light from the old fireplace. In the field while resting the horses, he would take off his hat in which was hidden the spelling book and while he was pretending to be looking in his hat for vermin which were quite plentiful at that time, he was studying the words he was learning. He would then go on to the end of the row, spelling as he plowed. It would have been disastrous to him if he had been caught. A negro that could read was considered dangerous. He persevered until he could both read and write. In later years, when he became free, it was his habit to pick up a piece of paper, while resting in the garden, and read. My father never had an opportunity to go to school.           My mother was sold twice so far as I can remember. I remember mother's telling me about her only brother's     
     tink about Jesus Christ, and wish to be like him.               Can you read?               A little.               Who taught you to read?               God teach me to read.               What do you mean by saying so?               God give me desire to read, and dat make reading easy. Massa give me Bible, and one sailor show me de letters; and so me learned to read by myself, with God's goot help.               And what do you read in the Bible?               O! me read all about Jesus Christ, and how he loved sinners; and wicked men killed him, and he died, and came again from the grave, and all dis for negro. And it sometime make me cry, to tink dat Christ love so poor negro.               And what do the people say about your reading and praying, and attention to the things of God?               Some wicked people dat do not love Jesus Christ, call me great fool, and negro dog, and black hypocrite. And dat make me sometime feel angry: but den me remember Christian must not be angry for dat. Jesus Christ was called ugly black names, and he was quiet as a lamb; and den me remember Jesus Christ, and me say noting again to dem.       
      the woods and watch the men go to their work. I would stay  in the woods all day and then come back at night. Of course I  could not have done this if the colored people had not been  friendly to me. Finally my mother got notice that if I would  come back and give myself up they would put me to work on the plantation, helping the boys feed the horses and things  of that kind, that Mr. Peed did not own me any more for they  had given him his money back when I ran away. So I gave  myself up, but very soon the folks up at the big house began  to find fault about my being on the place, so my master sold  me the third time. He virtually gave me away, for he received  only $50 for me and sold me to a poor white woman of the  neighborhood. She was very good to me. She had a little farm  and was what might be called one of the  poor whites.  The  plantation owners considered any one who did not own a good deal of property and slaves poor. She was named Mrs. Wheeler.  But she got tired of me for some reason and sold me to a  party who was to come for me. But before they could come to  take me away I ran away. I went to the city of Newbern and  hired out as a bell boy at the Moore Hotel. Of course they did not know that I was a runaway slave and they did not  know my name, either, for I would not tell them. They called  me the  Don't know  boy. But they gave me three dollars a  week and my food. I was then about ten years old. I stayed at  the Moore House three years. I left because some of the other  colored boys about there had found out who I was and said  they were going to give me away. So I went back to the  plantation again to my mother's house. She told me that they  had promised not to sell me any more if I would give myself  up and go on the plantation and go to work. And she wanted me to do that, because she was very tired of my  foolishness, as she called it, in running away and going  about the country. So I did give myself up. I went to the  big house and saw my master and told him I had come home to stay now. He was a tall, raw-boned, black faced man,  quite old then, too old to go to war when the war came. He  said,  All right, go out to the barn and go to work and it  will be all right. Go out and help the men take care of the  horses and stay home.  And I did. I learned to plow and to do all kinds of work about the plantation and in the cotton and  corn fields. I was not given any chance to learn a trade,  though. And of course I was given no opportunity to learn to  read. There was no school for the slaves to attend. I would  not have wanted to go to school any way for my only  experience with a book was not a pleasant one. One day my  master's son, who was just my age, had a bag coining home  from school and he gave me the bag to carry. The bag had  books in it. I slung the bag over my shoulder but did not  take any of the books out. But Edward said I took one of his books out of the bag and opened it. When his father heard  that, he said he would teach me better things than to do that,  and he whipped me very severely. I cried and told him that  I did not take the book out, and then he whipped me all the  harder for disputing his word. He whipped me with a harness strap. That was not the first time my master whipped  me, however. Whipping with him was a very common thing. He  was one of the masters who believed in whipping their slaves  to keep them in subjection. If you looked cross at them,  they would whip you. They did not see the propriety of  treating their slaves well to get more out of them.              It was shortly after this that I learned that my master was  not only my master but my uncle and that his brother was my  father. I learned this first from my aunt. She heard about  my master whipping me and she said,  It is a great note for  him to whip you for that, because you are his own nephew.   That surprised me very much. I had heard the men about the  plantation before that speak about my being half white, but  I did not know why. My aunt also told me that once my master  and his brother had had a quarrel about it up at the big  house. But by that time I had settled down on the place and so there was no more said about it. Except once my  master's daughter, who very much resembled her mother for  her good disposition, referring to the fact said there  oughtn't to be so much trouble about it anyway, because we were one family and the time would come when the black  people would be free. This made her father very angry. She  had heard those things, I think, from her mother. It was her  mother who had owned the plantation originally, as I have  before mentioned. Upon her husband's death she later  married John Singleton, and he then became the master of  the plantation. But I            think they never agreed upon the question of having slaves.  She did not like the idea of owning slaves. She was a good  Christian woman and she believed the Bible did not teach  that it was right to own slaves. Shortly before her death  an incident occurred which made a very great impression upon  all of us for more reasons than one. She was very sick and  one day she called Frank, the carpenter, and who as the head  slave had charge of the others, and told him to bring into  her room all the slaves he could find on the plantation. They  were shelling corn at the time, getting it ready to ship to  the market, and he brought in as many as he could get  together, I suppose, in a short time. I was not one of them,  but I was later told by the others what happened. She said  to them,  Be good and do your work and the time will come  when you will all be free. The North is not satisfied with  slavery.  My master's brother was present and heard this and  after that we were treated very much worse than before.  Whenever they saw a group of us standing together they would  come up and make us disperse for fear we were going to raise  against them. Shortly after that our mistress died and on  the day of the funeral all of us slaves on the plantation,  between seventy-five and a hundred, men, women and children,  followed her body to the cemetery, about five miles away,  where she was buried.             It was a very sad occasion, for all the women were crying and  most of the men too, as well as the children. We knew that  she was the best friend we had and that now our lot would be  harder. Shortly after that my master married again, but our  new mistress did not have the kind heart our old mistress  had had.             I do not remember just the year our mistress died and told us  that we would some time be free, but I think it was about  1858. At any rate, it was not long before we began to hear  talk of a war. Our masters were afraid that there would be  a war. They kept talking against the North. They told us that  the white people in the North were nothing but shop slaves.  That the white girls were slaves who did the house work for  the Northern people and that the Northern people were not  considered as high class people as the Southern people. It  was about this time, too, that we first heard of a man named  Lincoln. They said he was a bad man and that he had horns.  Another man we heard about was John Brown and the underground  railroad. Of course we did not understand what the  underground railroad was. We thought it was some sort of a  road under the ground. We only knew, of course, what we were  told. We could not read or write and if any of us had tried  to learn to read or write we would have been severely  punished. One reason for the prejudice which the plantation  owners had against the poor white people in every community  was that these poor white people naturally sympathized with  us and the plantation owners were afraid that because of this  they might teach us to read or might give us some information  about what the North was trying to do. So we learned little  about the outside world. We did learn, however, that a man  named Wendell Phillips and a man named Garrison were getting  slaves into Canada and we were told that once you got into  Canada they could not get you back again, that you were free.  Of course the slaves as a whole wanted to be free. Many of  them were not treated well and the thought of being sold was  a very burdensome thing. The slaves on our plantation had  been told that they were going to be free, and they were  looking for what their mistress had said to come true. Then  Colonel Nelson, who owned an adjoining plantation, set all  his slaves free by his will when he died and they were all  sent to Liberia. There were about seventy-five of them. And  we were anxious to be free too.              I do not mean by all this that our life was altogether bad.  We had enough to eat and we had certain pleasures. It was a  common thing for the slaves to have parties where the slaves  from adjoining plantations came together and danced and sang  and played. The masters encouraged these parties for the  purpose of getting the young men and women slaves acquainted  with one another. They were looked forward to with pleasure,  for they were the chief social events.             Another thing we liked to do was attend the camp meetings. We  liked the singing and speaking. And then it was something for  us to go to. One of the worst features of slavery was that  the slaves on a plantation were virtually in prison. They  could not leave the plantation except with the            consent of their masters. Then no matter how hard they worked  they had nothing which they could call their own. Even their  children did not belong to them. And they themselves were  liable to be sold away to a distant part of the country to a  master whom they did not know and who might be very cruel to  them. Then as there were no schools for us and as we could  not read you can see how we would want to go to camp meetings  or to church. So we were always glad when Sunday came. On  Sunday, masters and slaves all went to church together.             Our master was a very religious man, being a local preacher  in the Methodist church. Once every three months the  Presiding Elder used to visit the church and hold a quarterly  meeting after he had preached. On one of those visits an  incident occurred that I still remember even after so many  years. It showed how bitter our masters were toward any one  who sympathized with us. And it marked, too, the breaking off  of religious association between our part of the South and  the North.      III             I cannot remember when the church incident with relation to  the Presiding Elder occurred, but it could not have been so  very long before the beginning of the war. We slaves used to  go to the same church our master and the other plantation  owners attended. Of course we used to sit back by the door  by ourselves while they sat up front. The church was about  five miles away from our plantation. We slaves used to walk  while our masters rode. This Sunday for some reason they  left me at home. But after they were gone I happened to  think of a donkey I often rode and the thought occurred to me  that I might ride him to church. So I got on his back and  started off. He carried me to church in good style but when  we reached there instead of waiting for me to get off he  threw me off. I had no rope to tie him, so I left him outside  and went in the church. The result was that he got in a fight  with another donkey while the church services was in progress  and created such a disturbance that I was later given a  severe whipping for it.             But another thing happened during that service which caused  a greater commotion than my donkey. Mr. Ayers, the Presiding  Elder, called upon a colored man named Ennis Dilamar to pray.  Ennis was a slave who had recently been purchased by my  master and who had quite a local reputation as a religious  man. The fact that Mr. Ayers should call upon a slave to pray  caused great offense to the plantation owners and after the  service was over and while the masters and their families  were arranging themselves on the ground to eat their dinner,  my master called Ennis to him and asked him what he meant by  asking God to send the time when Ethiopia should stretch  forth her arm like an army with banners, and said that he  would teach him better than to use such words as that. Of  course Ennis could not make any reply to this. He had simply  been repeating what he had heard some white man say, because  he himself could neither read nor write. However, they gave  him a severe whipping right then and there. This seemed to  disturb Mr. Ayers very much. He withdrew from the company and  went over to where the slaves were preparing their dinner and  told them that he did not see why a Christian man could not  be allowed to use his gift of prayer even if he was black.  In some way this remark got to the white people. So when the  afternoon meeting was called my master told Mr. Ayers that  his service was no longer wanted and that he need not visit  the church any more. From that time on my master had charge  of the meetings as local preacher and we never saw Mr. Ayers  again.             This incident, as I say, must have happened a short time  before the beginning of the war, because shortly afterwards  Samuel Hymans, a young man from our community who was  attending West Point, came home for a vacation, but when the  vacation was over he did not return to West Point. Instead  he commenced to organize a company of soldiers. I was very  anxious to go with him as his servant and my master, at his  request, let me do so. The reason why I was anxious to go  with Hymans was because I wanted to learn how to drill. I did  learn to drill. In fact I learned how to drill so well that  after a while when he was busy with other matters he would  tell me to drill the company for him. After Fort Sumpter      
     of a dime, or some other small coin, to each. Usually, this was the only time in the year when he and his slaves met each other face to face.             On arriving in Richmond, Anthony found that a master had already been provided for himself in the person of Brent's brother-in-law. A day's acquaintance satisfied him that they would never get on harmoniously together, and he refused his assent to the arrangement. In the mean time, he busied himself with providing situations for the slaves that had been placed in his charge. Having accomplished this, he then found a place for himself with the proprietor of a large flouring establishment where an elder brother was already employed. All being thus happily provided for by the enterprise and address of Anthony, nothing remained for the agent Brent but to execute the contracts in writing.             Meanwhile he had continued to make progress in his education. At Acquia, in Culpepper, in Falmouth, and in Fredericksburg, he had found one and another to assist him in the struggle. The spelling-book had been mastered, and the New Testament had begun to yield up its meaning to his patient application. At length he essayed a bolder flight. A part of his business had usually been to fetch his master's letters from the post-office. One day the thought struck him that if he were able to write, he too might send letters to his friends, and no one be the wiser. He resolved, if it were possible, to learn the precious art. He gathered from the street some torn scraps of paper           with writing upon them, and carefully imitated the characters. These rude copies he ventured to show to a young lady whom he had known as a child at Miss Horton's school. His confidence was not misplaced; although contrary to Virginia law, she kindly explained their meaning and lent him further aid. Thus, by the time he arrived in Richmond, he was already able to read and to write with a considerable degree of correctness. Such unusual attainments gave him a position in that city which he did not fail to improve to his own advantage, as well as that of others. He set up a school for the instruction of slaves--old as well as young--in reading. When the labors of the day were over, he was wont to meet twelve or fifteen in the house of a free negro woman for that purpose. This practice he continued for several months, and while it directly promoted his mental improvement, it was also a source of pecuniary profit.             At the end of his first year in Richmond, he changed his masters for the last time. His new employer was a druggist named Millspaugh. In about a week after Anthony had entered upon his new engagement, Millspaugh took him aside, and proposed a different arrangement. He had expected, he said, to have had employment enough to keep Anthony constantly busy, but found that such was not the case, and that he was likely to lose money by retaining him. He proposed, therefore, that Anthony should take the matter into his      
       knees before God prayed for this individual. The next morning the person came and asked her pardon. How beautifully  does this illustrate the passage,  Dearly beloved, avenge not  yourselves.  Again, returning home from meeting, one dark evening, with her head bowed down as usual, she was  accosted,  Where are  you  bound, old woman?   To  Canaan's happy land,   she answered.             Phebe  loved the Scriptures.  Near by her, and always on her mind and heart, was her   precious Holy Bible,  and her large-print Testament. Phebe had the same Bible that others  have, but she found in it a great deal more than is commonly found, as all may observe who have seen her Bible. There  the promises, and the threatenings and warnings too, are  marked or underscored by her pen or pencil. Phebe's marks beneath or beside a passage, made often with a heavy stroke  of her pencil, come to our minds with the force of a  commentary, for she was herself a  living epistle,   known and read  by us all. Said her  pastor,  *    If a thousand devoted Christians were requested  to mark their favourite texts and  expressions, it is believed they would hardly mark one not understood by Phebe.                  * Phebe was a Member of the Congregational Church of  America, corresponding to the  Independents in England.               Phebe  loved the house of God.  She took great delight in the services of the sanctuary: hence  she was never absent except from sickness or urgent necessity. She was indeed a pillar of the church; one in whom the  minister found support by her constant attendance and  prayers, by her cordial reception and love of the truth. She was the first to be seated in her place at church. For many years, in our former house of worship, she was seen sitting in  one corner of the gallery, on the furthest row of seats, with her head bowed in secret prayer. To look up to her as we entered the house of God was, to some of us at least, a prayer, a  sermon, a hymn of praise. The last winter, her health failing, she was unable to walk to church as formerly, and remained during the intermission--a season highly     
   this man whatever he wants to eat and drink, and I will pay it.  Then the landlord turned to me and said,  I will give you seventy-five dollars a month if you will act as porter for me.  I assured him that I would do so. The colored men I left behind, who came on the ship the same time, I met at the door. I said to them,  Give me your names, gentlemen; also your baggage.  Say they,  Get out; where is the landlord?   Give me your baggage, and just walk into the sitting-room.  But they still refused to do so. I then called the attention of the landlord, who said,  Give your baggage to this man, for he is the porter, and he is the proper representative to take care of it;  which of course made me walk as though I owned all the house. You remember just the night before I had nowhere to lay my head; and being raised from that situation to the porterage of one of the finest hotels in Panama, it was a large jump. Reader, do you not think I should have been grateful for such a great beneficent benefactor? How I should strive to render due gratitude unto Him: I should say with the poet--                At supper time I rang the bell, and they all came down to supper, the passengers looking upon me with much astonishment. One of them, of dark hue, who had not treated me with the respect he ought to have done, said,  Hallo, Williams, how is it that you have got to be porter here?  This was done to blandish me. I then thought it was my time to treat him with the same contempt that he had treated me with on the boat. This you know was wrong; it was not doing as my Bible taught me. I once heard of a little girl who read her Bible, and gave proof that she was governed by its precepts. The facts were these: she had been to school; on her way home she met with a little girl who always made it a point to push her out of the path. This day it pleased her teacher to give Emma, for that was her name, a great many bunches of grapes, and on her way home, as usual, she came in contact with the other little girl, and she gave this same little girl some of them. Going home     
     off the place. In order to keep them on the place he used to give them wives right on the place. He would not allow his slaves to take wives that did not belong to his plantation. Whenever he thought one of his men needed a wife or one of his women needed a husband he would choose them and put them together. If he did not own them he would go and buy a wife or a husband for those that he thought were old enough and needed them. He would never allow the men to be single after they were eighteen, nor the women after they were fifteen. I remember one day, when he had returned from town with about twenty-five heads of slaves, he called out all those who had no wives or husbands on the place. Said he, 'Well, boys, I've gotten a fine set of girls for you, and I am going to put you all together; likewise you, girls, I've got these fine boys, and I am going to put you all together, so that there will be no reason for any of you to have wives and husbands off the place. That old practice has got to stop;' so then he gave each one his wife or husband; he chose them out himself.               Did he give you one, too, Uncle Stephen?                       Why, yes, child, he gave me mine, too.               What did you say?               Well, what could I say, but take her and go along? But I tell you, child, there was great sorrow on the place that day. Many of us had wives or husbands on neighboring plantations; I myself had my wife on another plantation. The woman my master gave me had a husband on another plantation. Every thing was mixed up. My other wife had two children for me, but the woman master gave me had no children. We were put in the same cabin, but both of us cried, me for my old wife and she for her old husband. As I could read and write I used to write out passes for myself, so I could go and see my old wife; and I wrote passes for the other men on the place, so they could go and see their wives that lived off the place.        
    mill. They were dressed with shirts made of coarse bagging, such as coffee-sacks are made from, and some kind of light substance for pantaloons, and  no other clothing whatever.  They had on no shoes, hats, vests, or coats, and when my brother asked them why they spoke of our being dressed with those articles of clothing, they said they had  never seen negroes dressed in that way before.  They looked very hungry, and we divided our bread and meat among them, which furnished them only a mouthful each. They never had any meat, they said, given them by their masters. My brother put various questions to them, such as,  if they had wives?   did they go to church?   had they any sisters?   c. The one who gave us the information, said they had wives, but were obliged to marry on their own plantation. Master would not allow them to go away from home to marry, consequently he said they were all related to each other, and master made them marry,  whether related or not.  My brother asked this man to show him his sisters; he said he could not tell them from the rest,  they were all his sisters;  and here let me state, what is well known by many people, that no such thing as real marriage is allowed to exist among the slaves. Talk of marriage under such a system! Why, the owner of a Turkish harem, or the keeper of a house of ill-fame, might as well allow the inmates of their establishments to marry as for a Southern slaveholder to do the same. Marriage, as is well known, is the voluntary and perfect union of one man with one woman, without depending upon the will of a third party. This never can take place under slavery, for the moment a slave is allowed to form such a connection as he chooses, the spell of         slavery is dissolved. The slave's wife is his, only at the will of her master, who may violate her chastity with impunity: It is my candid opinion that one of the strongest motives which operate upon the slaveholders, and induce them to retain their iron grasp upon the unfortunate slave, is because it gives them such unlimited control in this respect over the female slaves. The greater part of slaveholders are licentious men, and the most respectable and the kindest of masters, keep some of their slaves as mistresses. It is for their pecuniary interest to do so in several respects. Their progeny is so many dollars and cents in their pockets, instead of being a bill of expense to them, as would be the case if their slaves were free; and mulatto slaves command a higher price than dark colored ones; but it is too horrid a subject to describe. Suffice it to say, that no slave has the least certainty of being able to retain his wife or her husband a single hour; so that the slave is placed under strong inducements not to form a union of  love,  for he knows not how soon the chords wound around his heart would be snapped asunder, by the hand of the brutal slave-dealer. Northern people sustain slavery, knowing that it is a system of perfect licentiousness, and yet go to church and boast of their purity and holiness!            On this plantation, the slaves were never allowed to attend church, but managed their religious affairs in their own way. An old slave, whom they called Uncle John, decided upon their piety, and would baptize them during the silent watches of the night, while their master was  taking his rest in sleep.  Thus is the slave under the necessity of even  saving his soul  in the hours when the eye of his master, who      
              Mrs. Gaines, as she approached the kitchen, heard the servant's musical voice and knew that he was in high glee; entering, she said,  Ah! Cato, you're ready, are you? Where is Hannah?              Cato.   Yes, missis; I is bin waitin' dis long time. Hannah has bin here tryin' to swade me to tell you dat I don't want her; but I telled her dat you sed I must jump de broomstick wid her, an' I is gwine to mind you.              Mrs. G.   That's right, Cato; servants should always mind their masters and mistresses, without asking a question.              Cato.   Yes, missis, I allers dose what you and massa tells me, an' axes nobody.             While the mistress went in search of Hannah, Dolly came in saying,  Oh, Cato, do go an' tell missis dat you don't want Hannah. Don't yer he hear how she's whippin' her in de cellar? Do go an' tell missis dat you don't want Hannah, and den she'll stop whippin' her.              Cato.   No, Dolly, I ain't a gwine to do no such a thing, kase ef I tell missis dat I don't want Hannah, den missis will whip me; an' I ain't a-gwine to be whipped fer you, ner Hannah, ner nobody else. No, I'll jump the broomstick wid every woman on de place, ef missis wants me to, before I'll be whipped.              Dolly.   Cato, ef I was in Hannah's place, I'd see you in de bottomless pit before I'd live wid you, you great, big, wall-eyed, empty-headed, knock-kneed fool. You're as mean as your devilish old missis.                      Cato.   Ef you don't quit dat busin' me, Dolly, I'll tell missis as soon as she comes in, an' she'll whip you, you know she will.             As Mrs. Gaines entered she said,  You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Hannah, to make me fatigue myself in this way, to make you do your duty. It's very naughty in you, Hannah. Now, Dolly, you and Susan get the broom, and get out in the middle of the room. There, hold it a little lower--a little higher; there, that'll do. Now, remember that this is a solemn occasion; you are going to jump into matrimony. Now, Cato, take hold of Hannah's hand. There, now, why could n't you let Cato take hold of your hand before? Now, get ready, and when I count three, do you jump. Eyes on the  broomstick!  All ready. One, two, three, and over you go. There, now you're husband and wife, and if you don't live happy together, it's your own fault; for I am sure there's nothing to hinder it. Now, Hannah, come up to the house, and I'll give you some whiskey, and you can make some apple-toddy, and you and Cato can have a fine time. Now, I'll go back to the parlor.              Dolly.   I tell you what, Susan, when I get married, I is gwine to have a preacher to marry me. I ain't a-gwine to jump de broomstick. Dat will do for fiel' hands, but house servants ought to be 'bove dat.              Susan.   Well, chile, you can't spect any ting else from ole missis. She come from down in Carlina, from 'mong de poor white trash. She don't know any         better. You can't speck nothin' more dan a jump from a frog. Missis says she is one ob de akastocacy; but she ain't no more of an akastocacy dan I is. Missis says she wits born wid a silver spoon in her mouf; ef she was I wish it had a-choked her, dat' what I wish.             The mode of jumping the broomstick was the general custom in the rural districts of the South, forty years ago; and, as there was no law whatever in regard to the marriage of slaves, this custom had as binding force with the negroes, as if they had been joined by a clergyman; the difference being the one was not so high-toned as the other. Yet, it must be admitted that the blacks always preferred being married by a clergyman.     CHAPTER V.            DR. GAINES and wife having spent the heated season at the North, travelling for pleasure and seeking information upon the mode of agriculture practised in the free States, returned home filled with new ideas which they were anxious to put into immediate execution, and, therefore, a radical change was at once commenced.            Two of the most interesting changes proposed, were the introduction of a plow, which was to take the place of the heavy, unwieldy one then in use,     
  Price, a steamboat owner and commission merchant,  living in the city of St. Louis. Captain Price tendered seven hundred dollars, which was two hundred more than Mr. Willi had paid. He therefore thought best to accept the offer. I was wanted for a carriage driver, and Mrs. Price was very much pleased with the captain's bargain. His family consisted of himself, wife, one child, and three servants, besides myself, -- one man and two women.          Mrs. Price was very proud of her servants, always keeping them well dressed, and as soon as I had been purchased, she resolved to have a new carriage. And soon one was procured, and all preparations were made for a turn-out in grand style, I being the driver.          One of the female servants was a girl some eighteen or twenty years of age, named Maria. Mrs. Price was very soon determined to have us united, if she could so arrange matters. She would often urge upon me the necessity of having a wife, saying that it would be so pleasant for me to take one in the same family! But getting married,  while in slavery, was the last of my thoughts; and had I been ever so inclined, I should not have       married Maria, as my love had already gone in another quarter. Mrs. Price soon found out that her efforts at this match-making between Maria and myself would not prove successful. She also discovered (or thought she had) that I was rather partial to a girl named Eliza, who was owned by Dr. Mills. This induced her at once to endeavor the purchase of Eliza, so great was her desire to get me a wife!          Before making the attempt, however, she deemed it best to talk to me a little upon the subject of love, courtship, and marriage. Accordingly, one afternoon she called me into her room -- telling me to take a chair and sit down. I did so, thinking it rather strange, for servants are not very often asked thus to sit down in the same room with the master or mistress. She said that she had found out that I did not care enough about Maria to marry her. I told her that was true. She then asked me if there was not a girl in the city that I loved. Well, now, this was coming into too close quarters with me! People, generally, don't like to tell their love stories to everybody that may think fit to ask about them, and it was so with me. But, after blushing a while and recovering myself, I told her 		          that I did not want a wife. She then asked me if I did not think something of Eliza. I told her that I did. She then said that if I wished to marry Eliza, she would purchase her if she could.          I gave but little encouragement to this proposition,  as I was determined to make another trial to get my liberty, and I knew that if I should have a wife, I should not be willing to leave her behind; and if I should attempt to bring her with me, the chances would be difficult for success. However, Eliza was purchased, and brought into the family.           CHAPTER  X.           BUT the more I thought  of the trap laid by Mrs. Price to make me satisfied with my new home, by getting me a wife, the more I determined never to marry any woman on earth until I should get my liberty. But this secret I was compelled to keep to myself, which placed me in a very critical position.  I must keep upon good terms with Mrs. Price and Eliza. I therefore promised Mrs. Price that I would marry Eliza; but said that I was not then ready. And I had to keep upon good terms with Eliza, for fear that Mrs. Price would find out that I did not intend to get married.          I have here spoken of marriage, and it is very common among slaves themselves to talk of it. And it is common for slaves to be married; or at least to have the marriage ceremony performed. But there is no such thing as slaves being lawfully married. There has never yet a case occurred where a slave has been tried for bigamy. The man may have as many women as he wishes,       and the women as many men; and the law takes no cognizance of such acts among slaves. And in fact some masters, when they have sold the husband from the wife, compel her to take another.         There lived opposite Captain Price's, Doctor Farrar, well known in St. Louis. He sold a man named Ben, to one of the traders. He also owned Ben's wife, and in a few days he compelled Sally (that was her name) to marry Peter, another man belonging to him. I asked Sally  why she married  Peter so soon after Ben was sold.  She said,  because master made her do it.           Mr. John Calvert, who resided near our place, had a woman named Lavinia. She was quite young, and a man to whom she was about to be married was sold, and carried into the country near St. Charles, about twenty miles from St. Louis. Mr. Calvert wanted her to get a husband; but she had resolved not to marry any other man, and she refused. Mr. Calvert whipped her in such a manner that it was thought she would die. Some of the citizens had him arrested, but it was soon hushed up. And that was the last of it. The       woman did not die, but it would have been the same if she had.          Captain Price purchased me in the month of October, and I remained with him until December, when the family made a voyage to New Orleans, in a boat owned by himself, and named the  Chester.  I served on board as one of the stewards. On arriving at New Orleans, about the middle of the month, the boat took in freight for Cincinnati; and it was decided that the family should go up the river in her, and what was of more interest to me, I was to accompany them.          The long looked for opportunity to make my escape from slavery was near at hand.          Captain Price had some fears as to the propriety of taking me near a free state, or a place where it was likely I could run away, with a prospect of liberty. He asked me if I had ever been in a free state.  Oh yes,  said I,  I have been in Ohio; my master carried me into that state once, but I never liked a free state.           It was soon decided that it would be safe to take me with them, and what made it more safe, Eliza was on the boat with us, and Mrs. Price, to try me, asked if I thought as much as ever of Eliza. 		      
   would whip every man who favored the clean sheet idea. That ended the new idea and I heard no more of it. I was then living on a farm in that neighborhood and know whereof  I speak.           There is this to be said for the slaveholders in that part of the country, at least, that they believed in having their slave women live a virtuous life, and encouraged  them in getting married, and did not under any circumstances allow plural marriages among them. Of course there would be occasionally a strange freak, a black mother with a very light-colored child, whose real father's name was never stated, but these cases were rare, the exception rather than the rule. When two lovers became engaged, the consent of the girl's parents, and that of both masters, if they belonged to different owners, had to be obtained. Then the girl's master would give them a wedding supper, and invite a few of his white friends, who would dine first, then the bridal party and their invited guests. The ceremony was usually performed by a colored preacher. After supper dancing commenced, which lasted until a late hour, when they would disperse. The master had built and furnished a cabin for the couple, and when the time came to retire, they were conducted to their cabin and left, after receiving many blessings.           I have stated in this chapter, that there were many masters who encouraged slave girls in their efforts to live virtuous lives, and in a former chapter, I stated that there were thousands of high-toned families, although held in slavery by the laws of the land, and who clearly understood their helpless condition, and yet, by reason of having superior blood in their veins, were enabled thereby to attain the very best conditions possible     
     nature would have interposed the protecting arm of the law to shield the female when thus situated, from the brutal power of ferocious man. But no--even she can be laid down--exposed, and flogged, in the presence of the assembled population of the estate! It is true that public feeling, in this case more humane and merciful in its restrictions than the law--has, in a great measure, shielded the pregnant woman, known to be such, from so shocking an outrage; but still, instances of such barbarity we believe too often occur; ruining the unfortunate woman's health, and destroying her unborn child.             The evil of corporal punishment is also shewn in a way truly painful to every friend to the spread of christianity. We allude to the effect it produces, in respect to the ordinance of marriage It consists with our knowledge, that slaves have preferred concubinage to marriage on the          ground, that  their wives  might be indecently exposed, and cruelly flogged. And here it is to be observed, in explanation and support of this statement, that slaves, however licentious they may be, regard the marriage tie with a reverence and respect approaching to superstition. With whatever indifference they regard the degradation of  a concubine  we know that they look with horror on the degradation of  a wife!  Again, what kind of feeling can be expected to exist in the mind of a child, who witnesses the shameless punishment of a parent? Filial respect must be weakened, if not altogether destroyed.             And must not the feelings of the parent, who is constrained. to witness the miserable sufferings of a child, if not hardened in criminal indifference, be exquisitely painful. While we are upon this part of the subject, we cannot avoid recounting, as a proof that these things are not the chimeras     
      their masters, were ever disposed to regard them with less abhorrence than the overseer. And yet these masters would often go beyond their overseers in wanton cruelty. They wielded the lash without any sense of responsibility. They could cripple or kill without fear of consequences. I have seen my old master in a tempest of wrath, full of pride, hatred, jealousy, and revenge, where he seemed a very fiend.             The circumstances which I am about to narrate, and which gave rise to this fearful tempest of passion, were not singular, but very common in our slave-holding community.             The reader will have noticed that among the names of slaves, Esther is mentioned. This was a young woman who possessed that which was ever a curse to the slave girl--namely, personal beauty. She was tall, light-colored, well formed, and made a fine appearance. Esther was courted by  Ned Roberts,  the son of a favorite slave of Col. Lloyd, who was as fine-looking a young man as Esther was a woman. Some slave-holders would have been glad to have promoted the marriage of two such persons, but for some reason,  Captain Anthony disapproved of their courtship. He strictly ordered her to quit the company of young Roberts, telling her that he would punish her severely if he ever found her again in his company. But it was impossible to keep this couple apart. Meet they would, and meet they did. Had Mr. Anthony been himself a man of honor, his motives in this matter might have appeared more favorably. As it was, they appeared as abhorrent as they were contemptible. It was one of the damning characteristics of slavery, that it robbed its victims of every earthly incentive to a holy life. The fear of God and the hope of heaven were sufficient to sustain many slave women amidst the snares and dangers of their strange lot; but they were ever at the mercy of the power, passion, and caprice of their owners. Slavery  provided no means for the honorable perpetuation of the race. Yet despite of this destitution there were many men and women among the slaves who were true and faithful to each other through life.      
      poor girl to have at one time. So we ten bore right  square down on him, and he had to give in. We thought  better do that than to break the jury up, have another  trial, and run the risk. We then brought in a verdict  for $16,000 for the deserving lady, and I as one felt it  to be one of the proudest acts of my life.             During the balance of my stay there we had some  criticle   cases to decide, but in all cases I always cast my ballot  with the affirmative, except in one instance, the jury  stood seven to five, and I was with the seven. My last  foreman was Mr. Stokes, of the firm of Stokes   Leonard,  meat and produce dealers, and I served my time fully and  got my honorable discharge, and Mr. Stokes shook my hand  and told the Clerk of the Court, that I made one of the best   juriors  he ever knew.             The promises and obligations of marriage at the present  day differ from those of the past, because even in my day  the slaves stood more upon the principles and virtues of  marriage, than the people of the latter days. The marriage  vow was held very sacred. Where there are now one hundred  divorce cases, there was not one among the people of those  days. Why is this? Moses said it was on account of ignorance  that he gave them a writing of  divorcment  then. Now we have  the light of the gospel, which should guide us in the path  of righteousness. Let what may occur, a man should love and  respect his            wife and family, and seek not for a separation except for  the crime mentioned in the Scriptures.             The first miracle performed by our Saviour was at Cana, in   Galillee , at a marriage. St. Paul then picks up the subject  and says,  marriage is honorable among all men.  Therefore  about the year 1870, we struck that sacred key-note, and  commenced agitating the  intermarriage law,  in the State  of Rhode Island, which we thought was unjust, and an  outrage upon humanity. When we looked over history, and  found that law was placed on the Statute Book in 1784, by  such men as Capts. Gibbs, Scott, Townsend and others,  slaveholders of Rhode Island, we had a bitter contest  against it, year after year, for Rhode Island had at that  time sixty-five slavers, running out of Bristol, Newport  and Providence, doing nothing but running slaves, on her  import and her exports, and thousands of our colored  women's virtue was sacrificed, and fell victims under that  law. So we were determined to fight it out till it was  repealed. Year after year we were defeated, but kept on.  Every year when we came up with the petition, the question  would arise on every hand, Do you want your daughters to  marry a negro? So in 1879 the Journal came out in bitter  tones against us. There was'nt a day but she had the  marriage law or the color line in her papers. The colored  people were roused to the utmost. I published a card in the  paper, that it was'nt the color line or marriage question     
     and sturdy oaks, I felt as a king whose supreme  commands were  law and gospel  to my subjects. Here I dwelt for two years cultivating the cotton farm and  preaching at the same time. This was in the years of  1868-'69. Prior to this in 1866 I farmed on the old  plantation of Col. Johnston. My wife then  took in washing   and I ran  a one-horse farm.  Col. Johnston, the owner  of the place, conducted a large boarding school, and my  wife was laundress for the students. By this combination  of interests we made a  handsome living,  and all was well.            From my youth I felt a call to preach the gospel,  although I saw no opening for such a thing in the days of  slavery; but still there was a hope and a lingering anticipation  that somehow, in the divine arrangements, I  would ultimately have an opportunity to proclaim God's  truth. In the little church that stands beneath the oaks  and cedars, in the village of Sparta, Ga., I was licensed  to preach. It was in February, 1868, under the pastorate  of Rev. A. J. Garrell, that I appeared before the  Quarterly Conference. Rev. W. H. Potter, D.D., was the  Presiding Elder. Bishop George F. Pierce being present,  I had to be examined by him. He was a wonderful  preacher, with wide influence, and august presence.  Everybody loved, respected, and some almost adored  him. Coming before such a high personage I was scared  out of my wits, and all that I had previously known  seemed to have taken the wings of the winds and fled  away. But I was examined pretty closely, especially on  the doctrines of the church, and the Bible, yet, somehow,  I came out all right. In 1862 I was married to Miss Harriett  A. Turner, a girl then fifteen years of age, who  had been reared by Bishop Pierce, and given by him to  his son-in-law, Mr. Turner, as a maid for his wife. We  were married in the spacious hall of the Bishop's  residence by him on the 8th day of November, 1862. The  Bishop's wife and daughters had provided for the occasion         a splendid repast of good things to eat. The table,  richly spread, with turkey, ham, cake, and many other  things, extended nearly the whole length of the spacious  dining hall.  The house girls  and  the house boys   and the most prominent persons of color were invited to  the wedding of the colored  swells.  The ladies  composing the Bishop's family, dressed my bride in the  gayest and most artistic style, with red flowers and scarlet  sashes predominating in the brilliant trail. As the  gorgeous flashes of waving scarlet and white softly moved  across the spacious hall and stood in the glare of the  light, I thought I saw in my Harriett an angel in the  dwarfed splendors of heaven as if ornamented with gems  set upon a background of gold. In the vision of life that  then threw its brightness upon me, I saw nothing but  the roseate splendors of its triumphs and its glory. But  since then I have seen something of its opposite phases,  and know much of its trials, reverses and disappointments.  From the union thus formed fourteen children  were born, but only nine of them lived. One of them,  the first child, a daughter, died in her seventeenth year.  The others died at birth. I have at present, eight living  children, four of whom are boys.            After I was licensed to preach in 1868, I belonged to  the M. E. Church, South, as all colored people did who  were Methodists in the slave States. In 1868 and 1869,  I was on the Hancock circuit which covered the entire  county. Rev. E. B. Oliver and myself were the pastors.  I was senior and he junior. There were seven churches  on the circuit, and we followed each other in rotation.  Brother Oliver was a great preacher, also great in prayer  and song. He was the popular man among the people  and their ideal man and pastor. He had a clear, loud,  high, ringing voice, with a rare depth of pathos and  sweetness. He could make his voice thunder, thud, or  scream, as the occasion required, and a few blasts, as it  were, of his silver clarion, in that  age of stone  was     
     possession of slaves. Then his accomplishments were complete. He was a very severe slave master. Those mushroon slaveholders  are much dreaded, as their severity knows no bounds .              I stated previously, in relating a sketch of my mother's history,  that she was married twice, and both husbands were to be sold and made their escape. They both gained their freedom. One was living,--the other died before the war. Both made every effort to find us, but to no purpose. It was some years before we got a correct account of her second husband, and he had no account of her, except once he heard that mother and children had perished in the woods while endeavoring to make their escape. In a few years after his arrival in the free States he married again.            When about sixteen years of age, while residing with her original master, my mother became acquainted with a young man, Mr. Adams, residing in a neighboring family, whom she much respected; but he was soon sold, and she lost trace of him entirely, as was the common occurrence with friends and companions though united by the nearest ties. When my mother  arrived at Captain Tirrell's, after leaving the boat, in her excitement she scarce observed anything except her little group so miraculously saved from perhaps a final separation in this world. She at length observed that the servant who was waiting  to take her to the Captain's residence in the country was the same man with whom she formed the acquaintance when sixteen years old, and they again renewed their acquaintance. He had been married and buried his wife. It appeared that his wife had been in Captain Tirrell's family many years, and he also, for some time. They had a number of children, and Capt.  Tirrell had sold them down South. This cruel blow, assisted by severe flogging and other ill treatment, rendered the mother  insane, and finally caused her death.                 After my mother had left the Captain to take care of herself and child, according to agreement with the Captain, she became engaged to Mr. Adams. He had bought himself previously for a large price. After they became acquainted, the Captain had an excellent opportunity of carrying out his stratagem. He  commenced bestowing charity upon Mr. Adams. As he had  purchased himself, and Capt. T. had agreed not to sell my mother, they had decided to marry at an early day. They hired a house in the city and were to commence housekeeping immediately. The Captain made him a number of presents and seemed much pleased with the arrangement. The day previous to the one set for the marriage, while they were setting their house in order, a man called and enquired for a nurse, pretending he wanted one of us. Mother was absent; he said he would call again, but he never came. On Wednesday evening we attended a  protracted meeting. After we had returned home and retired, a loud rap was heard at the door. My Aunt enquired who was there. The reply was,  Open the door or I will break it down.  In a moment in rushed seven men, four watchmen and three traders, and ordered mother to take my brother and me and  follow them, which she hastened to do as fast as possible, but we were not allowed time to put on our usual attire. They thrust us into a close carriage. For fear of my mother alarming the citizens they threw her to the ground and choked her until she was nearly strangled, then pushed her into a coach. The night was dark and dreary; the stars refused to shine, the moon to shed her light.                              'Tis not strange the heavenly orbs                           In silence blushed  ' neath Nature's sable garb                           When woman's gagged and rashly torn away                           Without blemish and without crime.      
  a friend to whom I could tell my story of sorrows, of  unsatisfied longing, of new and fondly cherished plans.  I wanted a companion whom I could love with all my  warm affections, who should love me in return with a  true and fervent heart, of whom I might think when  toiling for a selfish, unfeeling master, who shall dwell  fondly on my memory when we were separated during  the severe labors of the day, and with whom I might  enjoy the blessed happiness of social endearments after  the work of each day was over. My heart yearned to  have a home, if it was only the wretched home of the  unprotected slave, to have a wife to love me and to love.  It seems to me that no one can have such fondness of  love and such intensity of desire for  home  and home  affections, as the poor slave. Despised and trampled  upon by a cruel race of unfeeling men, the bondman  must die in the prime of his wretched life, if he finds no  refuge in a dear home, where love and sympathy shall  meet him from hearts made sacred to him by his own  irrepressible affection and tenderness for them. And so I  sought to love and win a true heart in return. I did this  too, with the full knowledge of the desperate agony  that the slave husband and father is exposed to. Had  I not seen this in the anguish of my own parents? Yea, I  saw it in every public auction, where men and women  and children were brought upon the block, examined,  and bought. I saw it on such occasions, in the hopeless  agony depicted on the countenance of husband and wife  there separated to meet no more in this cruel world;  and in the screams of wild despair and useless entreaty  which the mother, then deprived of her darling child,  sent forth. I heard the doom which stares every slave  parent in the face each waking and sleeping hour of an  unhappy life. And yet I sought to become a husband  and a father, because I felt that I could live no longer  unloved and unloving. I was married to Lucilla Smith, the slave to Mrs Moore.  We called  it and  we considered  it a  true  marriage,  although we knew well that marriage  was not permitted to the slaves as a sacred right   of the loving heart. Lucilla was seventeen years old           when we were married. I loved her with all my heart,  and she gave me a return for my affection with which I  was contented. Oh, God of love, thou knowest what  happy hours we have passed in each other's society in  our poor cabin. When we knelt in prayer, we never  forgot to ask God to save us from the misery of cruel  separation, while life and love were our portion. Oh,  how we have talked of this dreadful fate, and wept in  mingling sorrow, as we thought of our desolation, if we  should be parted and doomed to live on weary years,  away from each other's dear presence. We had three  dear little babes. Our fondness for our precious children  increased the current feeling of love for each other,  which filled our hearts. They were bright, precious  things, those little babes; at least so they seemed to us.  Lucilla and I were never tired of planning to improve  their condition, as far as might be done for slaves. We  prayed with new fervency to our Father in Heaven to  protect our precious babes. Lucilla was very proud of  me, because I could read and write, and she often spoke  of my teaching our dear little ones, and then she would  say, with tears,  Who knows, Thomas, but  they  may  yet be  free and happy?   Lucilla was a valuable slave  to her mistress. She was a seamstress, and very expert  at her needle. I had a constant dread that Mrs. Moore, her mistress,  would be in want of money, and sell my  dear wife. We constantly  dreaded a final separation.  Our affection for each other was very strong, and this  made us always apprehensive of a cruel parting. These  fears were well founded, as our sorrowing hearts too soon  learned. A few years of very pure and constant happiness  for slaves, passed away, and we were parted to  meet but once again till we meet in eternity. Mrs.  Moore left Wilmington, and moved to Newbern. She  carried with her my beloved Lucilla and my three children, Annie, four years old; Lizzie, two and a half years; and our sweet little babe, Charlie. She remained there eighteen months. And oh, how lonely and dreary and desponding were those months of lonely life to my crushed heart! My dear wife andmy precious children            were seventy-four miles distant from me, carried  away from me in utter scorn of my beseeching words. I was tempted to put an end to my wretched life. I  thought of my dear family by day and by night. A  deep despair was in my heart, such as no one is called  to bear in such cruel, crushing power as the poor slave,  severed forever from the objects of his love by the cupidity  of his brother. But that dark time of despair  passed away, and I saw once more my wife and children. Mrs. Moore left  Newbern for Tuscaloosa, Ala., and passing through Wilmington on her journey, she  spent one night in her old home. That night I passed  with my wife and children. Lucilla had pined away  under the agony of our separation, even more than I had  done. That night she wept on my bosom, and we mingled  bitter tears together. Our dear children were  baptized in the tears of agony that were wrung from  our breaking hearts. The just God will remember that  night in the last award that we and our oppressors are  to receive.          The next morning Mrs. Moore embarked on board  the packet. I followed my wife and children to the  boat, and parted from them without a word of farewell.  Our sobs and tears were our only adieu. Our hearts  were too full of anguish for any other expression of our  hopeless woe. I have never seen that dear family since, or have I heard from them since I parted from them  there. God only knows the bitterness of my agony,  experienced in the separation of my wife and children  from me. The memory of that great woe will find a  fresh impression on my heart while that heart shall  beat. How will the gifted and the great meet the charge  against them at the great day, as the judge shall say to  them, in stern displeasure,  I was sick, destitute, imprisoned,  helpless, and ye ministered not unto me; for when ye slighted and despised these wretched, pleading slaves, ye did these acts of scorn against me. Depart ye workers of iniquity.            After my purchase by  Owen Holmes, I hired my time at $150 per year, paid monthly. I rented a house       of Dr. E.J. Desert. I worked,  loading and unloading vessels that came into Wilmington, and could earn from one dollar to a  dollar and a quarter a day. While my wife and family were spared to bless my home by their presence and love, I was comparatively happy. But I found then that the agony of the terrible thought,  I  am a slave, my wife is a slave, my precious children are slaves,  grew bitter and insupportable, just as the happiness  in the society of my beloved home became more  distinct and abounding. And this one cup of bitterness  was ever at my lips.  Hearts of kind sympathy and  tender pity, did I not drain that cup of bitter woe to its  very dregs, when my family were carried off into returnless exile, and I was left a heart broken, lonely  man! Can you be still inactive while thousands are  drinking that potion of despair every year in this land  of schools and Bibles? After I parted from my family,  I continued to toil on, but not as I had done before.  My home was darker than the holds of ships in which  I worked. Its light, the bright, joyous light of love  and sympathy and mutual endearments, was quenched.  Ah me, how dark it left my poor heart. It was colder  than the winter wind and frost; the warm sunshine was  snatched away and my poor heart froze in its bitter  cold. Its gloom was deeper than the prison or cave  could make it. Was not there the  deserted  chairs and  beds, once occupied by the objects of a husband's and a  father's love? Deserted! How, and Why? The  answer, is not the unqualified condemnation of the government  and religion of this land? I could not go into  my cold, dark, cheerless house; the sight of its deserted  room was despair to my soul. So I worked on,  taking jobs whenever I could get them, and working  often till nearly morning, and never going to my home  for rest till I could toil no more. And so I passed four  years, and I began to feel that I could not live in utter  loneliness any longer. My heart was still and always  yearning for affection and sympathy and loving communion.  My wife was torn from me. I had ceased        to hope for another meeting with her in this world of oppression and suffering; so I sat down and wrote to Lucilla,that I could live alone no longer, and saying to her the sad farewell, which we could not say when we were sundered. I asked Mary R. Moore to come and cheer me in my desolate home. She became my wife, and, thank God,  she  has been rescued from slavery by the blessing of God and my efforts to save her. She is now my wife, and she is with me to day, and till death parts us, secure from the iron hand of slavery. Three of our dear children are with us, too, in the old Commonwealth. I cannot say they are in a  free  land, for, even here, in the city of Boston, where I am told, is kept the old cradle of liberty,  my  precious children are excluded from the public schools, because their skin is black. Still, Boston is better than Wilmington, inasmuch  as the rulers of this place permit me to send my children to any school at all. After my second marriage,  I hired my wife of her master, and paid for her time, $48 a year, for three years. We had one child while Mary was a slave. That child is still in chains. The fourth year, by the aid of a white friend, I purchased  my wife for $350. We had before determined to try to accomplish this enterprise in order that our dear babes might be free. Besides I felt that I could not bear another cruel separation from my wife and children. Yet, the dread of it was strong and unceasing  upon my mind. So we made a box, and, through a hole in the top, we put in every piece of money, from five cents up to a dollar, that we could save from our hard earnings. This object nerved us for unceasing toil, for twenty months or about that time. What hopes and fears beset us as those months wore away! I have been compelled to hide that box in a hole dug for it, when I knew the patrollers were coming to search my cabin. For well did I know, if they found my box, I should be penniless again. How often have I started and turned in sudden and terrible alarm, as I have dropped a piece of money into my box, and heard its loud ring upon the coin below, lest some prowling enemy            should hear it, and steal from me my hoarded treasure.  And how often have I started up in my sleep as  the storm has beat aloud upon my humble home, with  the cry of unspeakable agony in my heart, --  Then,  O God, they have taken my box, and my wife and babes  are still slaves.  When my box was broken open, I  still lacked a little of the $350 necessary to buy my  wife. The kind friend who had promised to aid me in  the contemplated purchase, made up the deficiency, and  I became the owner of my wife. We had three children  at this time, and, O, how my crushed heart was  uplifted in its pride and joy, as I took them in my arms  and thought that they were not slaves." These three  children are with me and with their mother now, where  the slave's chains and whips are heard no more. Oh,  how sweet is freedom to man! But doubly dear is the  consciousness to the father's heart, made bitter in its incurable  woe by the degradation of slavery, that his  dear child is never to be a slave! Would to God the  fathers of this nation were all possessed of a true consciousness  of these things; for then, surely, they would  will and secure the immediate ending of human bondage.          After I had purchased my wife, we still worked hard  and saved our earnings with great care, in order to get  some property in hand for future use. As I saved my  earnings, I got a white man whom I thought my friend  (his name I choose to keep back for the present,) to lay  it out for me. In this way I became the owner of the  cabin in which I lived, and two other small houses, all of which were held in the name of this supposed friend.  He held them in his own name for me. A slave cannot  hold property. I will here remark that I was deceived  by this man; and when I ran away from my  chains, after sending on my family, I was compelled to  sacrifice the whole of this property. I left it, because I could not get my own from his hands, and came off entirely destitute. Thank God,  I  got away, and now  I have no tears to shed over the loss of my houses.          During the winter of  1848-9, a kind lady came and         told me that some white men were plotting to enslave  my wife and children again. She advised me to get  them off to the free States as quickly and secretly as  possible. A lawyer of Wilmington told me they were  not safe, unless emancipated by a special act of the Legislature.  He was a member of the House, and tried  to get through the House a bill for their emancipation.  But there was so much ill feeling upon this question  that he could not do it. The Legislature threw it aside  at once. He then advised me to get them off to the  free States as my only course to save them. This I determined  to do if possible. I kept a good lookout for a  vessel. I found one, and made a bargain with the captain  to take on board for New York a free colored woman  and her three children. A kind friend gave me a  certificate of their freedom to the captain, and I brought  my wife and children on board at night, paid the captain  $25 for their fare, and staid on the wharf in torturing  fear till about sunrise, when I saw the vessel under  way. It was soon out of sight. When I went home,  threw myself on my knees, and poured out my soul  to God, to carry that ship and its precious cargo safely  and swiftly on to a free haven, and to guard and guide  me soon to a free home with my beloved family. And  so I kept on, praying, working, hoping, pining, for  nearly three weeks, when I received the happy news  that my dear ones were safe with a true-hearted friend  in Brooklyn. I had notified him beforehand that they  were coming; and now the good and glorious news  came that they were safe with Robert H. Cousins, where the slaveholders  could trouble them no more. I  had arranged with Mary when she left, to come on myself  as soon as I could get the money for my houses and  land. She was to write to me as though she had gone  to New York on a visit, intending to come back, and  she was to speak of New York as if she did not like it at  all. I knew my master would be very angry when he  heard she had gone unbeknown to him, and I thought  he would demand to see the letters my wife should get  friends in New York to write to me for her; and so I         made ready to meet and quiet his suspicions, while I  was plotting my own escape. For more than three  months I tried to get the money, or part of it for my  houses; but was put off and deceived, till I found I  must come off without a cent of the property I had tried  so hard to accumulate. I was required to call and see  my master every day, because he suspected me of design  to run away. He was taken suddenly sick, and  then I started for my wife and children. Before I give  a narrative of my escape, I will give copies of the letters  which passed between me and my wife, while I remained  in the land of bondage after her escape. These  letters with their post marks, are all in my possession  and can be examined by any one who may doubt their  authenticity, or the fidelity with which they are here  given. The kind friend who has written this narrative  for me, has corrected some mistakes in the construction  and spelling of these letters, and  some  he has left   uncorrected.  He has also omitted some repetitions;  otherwise they are given as exact copies. I wrote my  own letters; my wife wrote by the help of a friend. I  give all my letters, and the two from my wife which  I was able to keep. The following was written soon  after my wife started for New York.                                                                           Wilmington, N. C., July 11, 1849.            MY DEAR WIFE - I write these few lines to inform you that I am well, and hope they may find you and  the children well, and all the friends. My dear wife,  I long to see you and the children one time more in  this world. I hope to see you all soon. Don't get  out of heart, for I will come as soon as I can. I hope  it will not be long, for God will be my helper, and I  feel he will help me. My dear wife you must pray  for me that God may help me. Tell John he must be  a good boy till I see him. I must not forget sister  Chavis. She must pray for me, that God may help  me come out. Tell her I say that she must be faithful  to God; and I hope dear wife you will be faithful to  God. Tell sister Chavis that Henry will be out soon,      
     that region; I made a passage through the reed with a hot wire, polished it, and attached a clay pipe to the end, so that the smoke should be cooled in flowing through the stem like whiskey or rum in passing from the boiler through the worm of the still. These pipes I sold at ten cents apiece. In the early part of the night I would sell my tobacco and pipes, and manufacture them in the latter part. As the Legislature sit in Raleigh every year, I sold these articles considerably to the members, so that I became known not only in the city, but in many parts of the State, as a  tobacconist .            Perceiving that I was getting along so well, I began, slave as I was, to think about taking a wife. So I fixed my mind upon Miss Lucy Williams, a slave of Thomas Devereaux, Esq., an eminent lawyer in the place; but failed in my undertaking. Then I thought I never would marry; but at the end of two or three years my resolution began to slide away, till finding I could not keep it longer I set out once more in pursuit of a wife. So I fell in with her to whom I am now united, Miss MARTHA CURTIS, and the bargain between  us  was completed. I next went to her master, Mr. Boylan, and asked him, according to the custom, if I might  marry his woman.  His reply was,  Yes, if you will behave yourself.  I told him I would.  And make her behave herself?  To this I also assented; and then          proceeded to ask the approbation of my master, which was granted. So in May, 1828, I was bound as fast in wedlock as a slave can be. God may at any time sunder that band in a freeman; either master may do the same at pleasure in a slave. The bond is not recognized in law. But in my case it has never been broken; and now it cannot be, except by a higher power.            When we had been married nine months and one day, we were blessed with a son, and two years afterwards with a daughter. My wife also passed from the hands of Mr. Boylan, into those of Mr. BENJAMIN B. SMITH, a merchant, a member and class-leader in the Methodist church, and in much repute for his deep piety and devotion to religion. But grace (of course) had not wrought in the same  manner  upon the heart of Mr. Smith, as nature had done upon that of Mr. Boylan, who made no religious profession. This latter gentleman used to give my wife, who was a favorite slave, (her mother nursed every one of his own children,) sufficient food and clothing to render her comfortable, so that I had to spend for her but little, except to procure such small articles of extra comfort as I was prompted to from time to time. Indeed Mr. Boylan was regarded as a very kind master to all the slaves about him; that is, to his house servants; nor did he personally inflict much cruelty, if any, upon his field hands. The overseer on his     
     that he could in so short a time. He rapidly gained  the good will and confidence of Mr. McCormick.            During this time Alonzo Roberts and his son-in-law,  James Cook, have a falling out, resulting in a separation of hands. Mr. Roberts takes those  belonging to him, and William finds himself again  under his old master. When his time expired with  Mr. McCormick, that gentleman was so much pleased  with his work and behavior that he offered to hire William from Mr. Roberts for the year at a good  price.            About this time our hero met a fine looking young woman, by the name of Ellen; to her it seems, judging  by after-events, he surrendered his heart. To use his own language in speaking of this event:  I was anxious to have a wife, as all young men are; true,  I did not count the cost or know the responsibility.             The summer and fall passed away in love-making  and working at the cooper's trade. By this time he  could turn out as many barrels a day as any one in  the shop; and when he considered this, it gave him  some idea what his freedom would be worth to him.  This strengthened his hope, and gave him courage to press forward. So well pleased was Mr. McCormick  with him, that at the beginning of the year 1850 he  offered Mr. Roberts three hundred dollars per year for his services, which offer was promptly accepted.            In March of this year William was married to  Ellen. This increased his responsibilities, and  made him more thoughtful and sedate. At the close of  this year William completed his trade, and won the reputation of being among the finest coopers of his  race. This he had accomplished with no aid from his           master; single-handed and alone, with the shackles of a slave upon him, he has risen above his condition and made for himself a name.            In January of the next year Dr. Hawkins offered William's master four hundred and fifty dollars per year for his services as foreman in his cooper shop, on the same plantation where William assisted in building the sugar-house in 1849. He entered upon his duties in a new shop on the old plantation, and for three years he works and manages the cooperage on the largest plantation on Bayou Boeuf.            At the expiration of this time, under the  employment of Dr. Hawkins, to use his own words:  I have now won public confidence, anything I wanted to go in, I had friends to help me.             William and Ellen had now been married three years, but those years had not been all sunshine.            Ellen's mistress had died in 1849, and her master wanted to take his children to their grandmother in Tennessee. This would compel a separation  between William and his wife.            It is difficult for us, at this period of time, to  realize the workings of the old  ante-bellum  system of slavery--the forcible separation of husband and wife being one of its most cruel features.            It must be said, however, to the credit of the  majority of slave-owners, that such cases were very rare. Sometimes it would happen in the division of an estate that the husband would fall to the share of one heir and the wife to another; but, even in such a case as this, unless widely separated by distance, the conjugal relation was kept up, and the children           of such a couple were adjudged the property of the owner of the wife.            Ellen's master was willing to sell or buy, but Mr.  Roberts was not willing to sell William.            Mr. Roberts had a talk with Ellen, and finding that  she was grieving so over the prospective separation,  he said to her:  Never mind, I will buy you. I  am willing to give one thousand dollars for you.             When Ellen reported this to William, he said to  her:  If anything should happen to you, I am powerless  to aid you; and I am afraid that I am an injury  to your interest. I would rather you would stay  with your present owners, as you are doing well now, and at some future day we may see each  other.             They had no children, and the reader must  remember that this was a matter of considerable  importance in those days. Naturally her owner was  disappointed in his expectations, and the consequence was Ellen was continually being offered for  sale.            Under these circumstances William was so much   harrassed  that he was unable to attend to his  business properly.            He had a friend, a man by the name of William  Scott, to whom he went, and laid the whole case  before him. Mr. Scott sympathized with his feelings  in the matter, and agreed to let him have the  money, one thousand dollars, at ten and a half per  cent. interest, with which amount William purchased  his wife, and so got rid of the fear of having her  separated from him.                     But who can describe Ellen's feelings at finding  herself freed from the haunting dread of being torn  from the arms of a loving husband, and perhaps  transported to some far distant State? Words are  inadequate to portray the happiness which filled her breast at the thought that she was no longer the  goods and chattels  of a white man, but the sole  property of her husband in deed and in truth.            When the time came for a settlement, Mr. Scott  charged William two hundred dollars hire for a boy  belonging to him, who had been learning the cooper's  trade. This caused some hard feelings and words,  so that Mr. Roberts was called in to arbitrate the  matter. The bill was an unjust one, but William, being a slave, could not protect himself, so he paid  the two hundred dollars, and submitted to the fraud  with the best grace he could.              CHAPTER VI.     WILLIAM'S INTERVIEW WITH MR. ROBERTS--SELLS HIS WIFE--BUYS HIMSELF--FIRST PAYMENT-- TROUBLE ABOUT RECEIPT, IN WHICH THREE TAKE PART--LEE DOUBTED--LAST PAYMENT--ANDREW JACKSON HOLDS DEED--WILLIAM A FREE MAN.              IN the fall of the same year William's master, Mr. Alonzo Roberts, saw an opportunity of buying a plantation, the first payment on which was one thousand dollars cash, the remainder,  fifteen hundred dollars, to be paid in two years. Mr. Roberts sent for William to know whether he wanted to buy himself. This long cherished desire of his heart now seemed about to be realized.            Mr. Roberts had always been so opposed to selling  him, that it was with great surprise William now listened to his proposition, but managed to conceal his astonishment and ask for time to  consider the matter.            William spent the next few days in seeking a  purchaser for his wife, being careful to find one from whom he could purchase her at any time he could raise the money. He finally found the right sort of a purchaser in the person of Mrs. Johnson, who bought Ellen for the sum of one thousand dollars, giving him the privilege of redeeming her at any time for a like sum.            It can readily be seen that Ellen had unbounded confidence in her husband, else she would never           have consented to this arrangement, which placed  her in the power of another owner besides the man  whom she loved and admired above all others.            With this money he then presented himself to his  master, ready to make the purchase of himself.  After paying Mr. Roberts the sum of one thousand  dollars, William asked for a receipt.            Mr. Roberts jokingly replied:  Go on, my boy;  I would not cheat you any quicker than I would my  son.             This was not at all satisfactory to William; but,  realizing his condition, he was forced to depend  upon this verbal promise.            During the next year, 1855, William worked  hard, encouraged by the thought that Mr. Roberts'  word was as good as his bond, in that he had always  been a good and kind master.            When the time arrived for the next payment,  which was in 1856, William thought he could gladden  the heart of his master by paying him more  than he expected; so he paid him eleven hundred  dollars, instead of the one thousand dollars, which  he expected, making a total of twenty-one hundred  dollars which he had paid him.            This time William endeavored to reason with him  about the receipt. He said:  Mr. Roberts, is it  not fair and just that I should have some sort of  writing to show that I have paid you twenty-one  hundred dollars?             Mr. Roberts' reply was:  Why, boy, you are  crazy; I would not cheat you any quicker than I  would my son.        
       CHAPTER II.             IN the locality where I lived there was no attention paid to the ceremony of marriage by the slaves. In fact on many plantations many of the slaves were not married at all but herded together very much like cattle, living in common quarters. On other plantations, slaves were allowed to marry, though it often happened that the husband lived on one plantation and the wife and her children upon another, but even in this case there was seldom any marriage ceremony performed.             If a young slave took a fancy to marry a slave girl, he first obtained the consent of the girl herself, which, if he was good looking and belonged to a good family, was easily obtained, but if he           was a  no-account nigger  owned by a failed planter or let out to a poor white the case was different. After obtaining the girl's consent he would go to his master or mistress, and ask for permission to marry, and if he stood well with them he had no difficulty in getting their consent. He would get permission to go to the plantation where his girl lived to obtain the consent of her master. When he arrived at the plantation where his girl lived, he would go directly to the owner, or master as he was called, and with whom be was most likely acquainted, and who had perhaps been informed by the young slave's master of the intended visit and its object; when a conversation something like the following would take place:              Hello Sam! Is that you?               Yes Massa, its me.               How is your Master and Mistress and the little folks?                       Dey is all well Massa, cept Mistress hab got a sore foot.               Is that so Sam, how did it happen?               D'no, spects she hurt it in de garden.               Well Sam, when you go home give her my compliments, and tell her that I hope she will not be laid up long, but by the way Sam, what message did your Master send by you?               Did'nt send no message, sar, I comed myself.               What! You don't mean to say that you have run away Sam?               No sar, Massa told me as how I might come and see Massa Jones.               Well Sam, what is it, does your Master intend to hire you out next year and you want me to hire you?               No sar, Massa John don't let his niggers, he wants me hisself. But I comed to see you Massa cause I think that you yellar gal Sue is a right smart, good gal.                       That so, Sam?               And I thought that perhaps, maybe, that seeing as you and Massa John was good friends, and being as I want no bad nigger at all, that maybe, possibly, you might consider to consent that me and she might be married.              At this stage of the proceedings the  man  would look the  property  over as carefully as a farmer would a horse or a cow he intended to purchase, knowing as he did so, that, if the marriage was a desirable one, it would be for his interest to give his consent, for would not all the children that might be born to the couple be his own property, and could he not thus increase the value of his personal estate?              Got any bad habits, Sam?               No sar.               Ever been whipped, Sam?               No sar.               Let me look at you, Sam?               Yes sar.                      Then Sam would be carefully looked over to see if he had any defects that would be objectional if transmitted to his offspring, then more questions would be asked.              Well Sam, I like your looks, and I will think it over. You come and see me next week and I will tell you.               Can I see Sue, Massa?               Yes Sam, you can see her when she comes from the field.              After spending some hours with his sweetheart, Sam would go home and at the end of the week would again get permission to go to the Jones Plantation, and upon arriving there he would as before, go at once to the master.              Hello! Sam, you here again, what do you want this time?               Well Massa Jones, I comed to see as to what you thought about me and Sue getting married.               Get out you nigger.               But Massa told Sam to come,                       How's that Sam?               Massa Jones told Sam to come in one week, and den Massa Jones tell Sam as how he can marry Sue or not.               O yes, I remember now, well Sam I have talked it over with Sue's Mistress and we have concluded to let you marry Sue, and I will have a cabin built down by the quarters and Sue can live there.               Thankie Massa.              Sam would go again and find Sue and they would spend the evening together and from that time would be considered as man and wife. But each would continue a slave and must do his or her master's bidding no matter how much it might conflict with their own ideas of right and wrong.             In due time the cabin would be built and would be considered as the home of Sue, and also of Sam, whenever he could get permission of his master to leave the plantation or whenever he could manage to steal away without leave.      
   and would pick a quarrel with one of them, so as to get an opportunity to punish him, he would say to him,  Oh! Ye think yourself as good as ye master, ye--  Of course the slaves knew what the overseer was after, so he was afraid to speak, the overseer, hearing no answer, would return to him and cry out,  ye so big ye can't speak to me, ye --,  and then the conflict would begin, and he would give that man such a punishment as would disable him for two or three weeks. Then the merciless overseer would say to him  ye think, because ye have a trade, ye are as good as ye master, ye--, but I will show ye that ye are but a nigger.            My father had two wives, his first had six children, four boys and two girls. His second wife had eight, six boys and two girls. Of course he did not marry his wives, as it was not allowed among the slaves, but he took them as his wives by mutual agreement. He had my mother for his wife after the death of his first wife, and I am the third son of his second wife. My readers, very naturally, would like to know whether some of the slaves did not have more than one woman. I answer they did, for, as they had no law to bind them to one woman, they could have as many as they pleased, by mutual agreement. But notwithstanding, they had a sense of the moral law, for many of them felt it was right to have but one woman.           I met one of my fellow negroes one day, who lived next neighbor to us, and I said to him  well, uncle William, how are you to-day?  his answer,        was,  thank God, my son, I have two wives now and must try to make out with them until I can get some more;  but while you would find many men like him, others would rebuke the idea of having more than one woman for a wife. But thanks be to God, that the time has come when the slave and master are each bound by the same law, which knows no man by condition or color.           As I have said, my father used to take care of horses and mules, and I was around with him in the barnyard when but a very small boy; of course that gave me an early relish for the occupation of hostler, and I soon made known my preference to Col. Singleton, who was a sportsman and had fine horses, and, although I was too small to work, the Colonel granted my request and I was allowed to be numbered among those who were taking care of the fine horses and to learn to ride. But I soon found that my new occupation demanded a little more than I cared for.           It was not long after I had entered my new work before they put me upon the back of a horse which threw me to the ground almost as soon as I reached his back. It hurt me a little, but that was not the worst of it, when I got up there was a man standing near with a switch in his hand and he immediately began to beat me. Although I was a very bad boy, this was the first time I was whipped by any one except father and mother, so I cried out in a tone of voice as if I would say, this is the first and last whipping you will give me, when father gets you. When     
      her window, and was greatly shocked at the murderous treatment of poor Robert, whom she truly loved, and whose only crime, in the eye of his persecutors, was his affection for her. This beating, and we know not what after treatment, completely subdued the spirit of its victim, for Robert ventured no more to visit Isabella, but like an obedient and faithful chattel, took himself a wife from the house of his master. Robert did not live many years after his last visit to Isabel, but took his departure to that country, where 'they neither marry nor are given in marriage,' and where the oppressor cannot molest.       ISABELLA'S MARRIAGE.                Subsequently, Isabella was married to a fellow-slave, named Thomas, who had previously had two wives, one of whom, if not both, had been torn from him and sold far away. And it is more than probable, that he was not only allowed but encouraged to take another at each successive sale. I say it is probable, because the writer of this knows from personal observation, that such is the custom among slaveholders at the present day; and that in a twenty months' residence among them, we never knew any one to open the lip against the practice; and when we severely censured it, the slaveholder had nothing to say; and the slave pleaded that, under existing circumstances, he could do no better.              Such an abominable state of things is silently tolerated, to say the least, by slaveholders--deny it who may. And what is that religion that sanctions, even by its silence, all that is embraced in the  'Peculiar Institution?'  If there              can  be any thing more diametrically opposed to the religion of Jesus, than the working of this soul-killing system--which is as truly sanctioned by the religion of America as are her ministers and churches--we wish to be shown where it can be found.              We have said, Isabella was married to Thomas--she was, after the fashion of slavery, one of the slaves performing the ceremony for them; as no true minister of Christ  can  perform, as in the presence of God, what he knows to be a mere  farce,  a  mock  marriage, unrecognized by any civil law, and liable to be annulled any moment, when the interest or caprice of the master should dictate.              With what feelings must slaveholders expect us to listen to their horror of amalgamation in prospect, while they are well aware that we know how calmly and quietly they contemplate the present state of licentiousness their own wicked laws have created, not only as it regards the slave, but as it regards the more privileged portion of the population of the South?              Slaveholders appear to me to take the same notice of the vices of the slave, as one does of the vicious disposition of his horse. They are often an inconvenience; further than that, they care not to trouble themselves about the matter.       ISABELLA AS A MOTHER.              In process of time, Isabella found herself the mother of five children, and she rejoiced in being permitted to be the instrument of increasing the property of her oppressors! Think, dear reader, without a blush, if you can, for one moment, of a  mother  thus willingly, and with  pride,  laying         
      CHAPTER IV.      COURTSHIP AND MARRIAGE  -  A SLAVEHOLDER'S IDEA OF ITS REQUIREMENTS  -  SEPARATION.           YEAR after year rolled on. Master Jonas Mannyfield lived seven miles from us, on the other side of the Blue Ridge; and he owned a likely young fellow called Jerry. We had always known each other, and now he wanted to marry me. Our masters were both willing; and there was nothing to hinder, except that there was no minister about there to marry us.  No matter for that,  Kibbler said to Jerry.  If you want Bett, and she wants you, that's the whole of it.  But I didn't think so. I said,  No: never till somebody comes along who can marry us.  So it happened, one day, there was a colored man  -  a pedler, with his cart  -  on the road, and Jerry brought him in, and said he was ready to be minister for us. He asked us a few questions, which we answered in a satisfactory manner, and then he declared us husband and wife. I did not want him to make us promise that we would always be true to each other, forsaking all others, as the white people do in their marriage service, because I knew that at any time our masters could compel us to break such a promise; and I had never forgotten the lesson learned, so many years before, in the blackberry pasture.           So Jerry and I were happy as, under all the circumstances, we could well be. When he asked his master's consent to our marriage, he told him he had had thoughts of removing         to Missouri, in which case he should take him with him, and we would have to be separated; but, if he chose to run the risk, he had nothing to say. Jerry did not think there was any danger, and we were not dissuaded; for hearts that love are much the same in bond or free, in white or black.           Eight or ten months passed on, when one night my brother Stephen, who lived on the Blue Ridge, near Master Mannyfield, came to see me, and, as we talked of many things, he spoke of Jerry in a way that instantly roused my suspicion. I said:  Tell me what is the matter? I know there is something. Is Jerry dead? Is he sold? Tell me what it is.  I saw he dreaded to speak, and that frightened me the more.           At last, he said:  'Tis no use, Betty. You have got to know it. Old Look-a-here's people are all in jail for debt.   Old Look-a-here  was the nickname by which Mannyfield was known by the colored people far and near, because he had a way of saying, when he was about to whip one of his slaves,  Now look-a-here, you black rascal,  or  you black wench.            The next day was Saturday, and I hurried to complete my task in the corn-field, and then asked my master if I could go to see Jerry. He objected at first, but at last gave me a pass to see my brother, and be gone until Monday morning.           The sun might have been two hours high when I started;  but, before I was half over the mountain, night had closed  round me its deepest gloom. The vivid flashes of lightning  made the carriage path plain at times, and then I could not  see a step before me; and the rolling thunder added to my  fear and dread. I was dripping wet when, about nine o'clock,  I reached the house. It had been my plan to get Stephen  to go on with me to Jerry's mother's, and stay the         night there; but his mistress, who was sister to my Miss Lucy, declared we must not go on in the storm, and, giving me supper, brought bedding, that I might lie on the kitchen floor and rest me there. In the morning, after a good breakfast, she started us off, with a bag of biscuits to eat by the way. Jerry's mother was glad to go with us; and we hurried along to Jerry, in jail at Little Washington, where he with his fellow-slaves was confined, like sheep or oxen, shut up in stalls, to be sold to pay their owner's debts.           Jerry saw us, as we came along the road, through the prison bars; and the jailer allowed us to talk together there, not, however, without a witness to all we might say. We had committed no offence against God or man. Jerry had not; and yet, like base criminals, we were denied even the consolation of privacy. This was a necessary part of the system of American slavery. Neither wife nor mother could intervene to soften its rigors one jot.           Several months passed, and Mannyfield was still unable to redeem his property; and they were at last put up at auction, and sold to the highest bidder. Frank White, a slave-trader, bought the entire lot, and proceeded at once to make up a gang for the Southern market.           Arrangements were made to start Friday morning; and on Thursday afternoon, chained together, the gang were taken across the stream, and encamped on its banks. White then went to Jerry, and, taking the handcuffs from his wrists, told him to go and stay the night with his wife, and see if he could persuade her to go with him. If he could, he would buy her, and so they need not be separated. He would pass that way in the morning, and see. Of course, Jerry was only too glad to come; and, at first, I  thought I would go with him. Then came the consciousness that this         inducement was only a sham, and that, once exposed for sale in a Southern market, the bidder with the largest sum of money would be our purchaser singly quite as surely as together; and, if separated, what would I do in a strange land? No: I would not go. It was far better for me to stay where, for miles and miles, I knew every one, and every one knew me. Then came the wish to secrete ourselves together in the mountains, or elsewhere, till White should be gone; but, to do this, detection was sure. Then we remembered that White had trusted us, in letting him come to me, and we felt ashamed, for a moment, as if we had tried to cheat; but what  right  had White to carry him away, or even to own him at all? Our poor, ignorant reasoning found it hard to understand his rights or our own; and we at last decided that, as soon as it was light, Jerry should take to the mountains, and, when White was surely gone, either I would join him there, and we would make for the North together, or he would come back, go to White's mother, who lived a few miles distant, and tell her he would work for her and obey her, but he would never go South to be worked to death in the rice-swamps or cotton-fields.           We talked late into the night; and at last, in the silence and dread, worn out with sorrow and fear, my head on his shoulder, we both dropped asleep.           Daylight was upon us when we waked. The sad consciousness of our condition, and our utter helplessness, overpowered us. I opened the door, and there was my mistress, with pail in hand, going to the spring for water.  Oh, what shall I do? Where shall I go?  cried Jerry, as he saw her.  Have no fear,  I said.  Go right along. I know mistress will never betray you.  And, with a bound, he was over the fence, into the fields, and off to the mountains.                  In a very short time, White and his poor, doomed company came along, and called for Jerry. I had taken my pail to milk the cows; and, seeing me, he sung out,  Woman, where is Jerry, I say?   I don't know where Jerry is,  I answered. Then, turning to Kibbler, who, hearing the outcry, now came out, he said,   You told me that woman wouldn't lie; and you know well enough she is lying now, when she says she don't know where that  -  rascal is.  Kibbler answered very slowly and thoughtfully,  I never knowed her to lie; but may be this time,  -  may be this time.  White then turned to me, and said,  I took off his handcuffs, and let him go to you, and you had no business to serve me so.            It was true I did not know where Jerry was at that time. We had agreed that we would meet that night near the blacksmith's old shop, on the other side of the run; and that was all I knew of his whereabouts, though he had not been gone long enough to be far away. It was true he had trusted us, and I felt very badly; but what else  could  we have done? Kind reader,  what  think you?           I then told him that Jerry had said he was willing to work, and would go to his mother's and serve her, but  never , if he could help it, would he be carried South.           Then White tried to bargain with Kibbler for my purchase, saying he would give any price he should name for me, because he knew I would then find Jerry. But it was no use. Kibbler had a kind spot in his heart, and would not consent to let me go. So the slave-trader moved on with his human cattle.           Five miles on the road lived David McCoy, another slavetrader. When White reached his house, it was agreed by them that, if McCoy could find Jerry within two days, he should bring him on, and they would meet at Stanton, Va.            CHAPTER V.      MEETING  -  A LAST INTERVIEW  -  SEPARATION.           THE place where I was to meet Jerry was, as I have said, across the run, in a corn-field, near the blacksmith's shop, the time Friday night.           It had rained hard all day, and the stream was swollen, and pouring and rushing at a fearful rate. I waited till everybody was in bed and asleep, when I lighted my pine knot, and started for the Pass. It was still raining, and the night was very dark. Only by my torch could I see a step before me; and, when I attempted to wade in, as I did in many different places, I found it was no use. I should surely be drowned if I persisted. So, disappointed and grieved, I gave up and went home. The next morning I was able to get over on horseback to milk the cows, but I neither heard nor saw anything of Jerry.           Saturday night came. I knew well that, if not caught by White, Jerry would be round. At last, every one was in bed, and all was still. I waited and listened. I listened and waited. Then I heard his step at the door. I hurriedly opened it, and he came in. His clothes were still damp and stiff from the rain of yesterday. He was frightened and uneasy. He had been hiding around in different places, constantly fearing detection. He had seen me from behind the old blacksmith's shop when I had tried the night before, with my pine knot, to ford the stream; and he was glad, he said, when he saw me go back, for he knew I should be carried         down by the current and be drowned, if I had persisted. I went to my mistress's bedroom, and asked her if I might go to the cellar. She knew at once what I meant, and whispered softly,  Betty, has Jerry come?  then, without waiting for reply, added,  get him some milk and light bread and butter.  I was not long in doing so; and the poor fellow ate like one famishing. Then he wanted to know all that had happened, and what White had said when he found he was gone. We talked a long time, and tried to devise some plans for our mutual safety and possible escape from slavery altogether; but, every way we looked, the path was beset with danger and exposure. We were both utterly disheartened. But sleep came at last and, for the time being, relieved us of our fears.           In the morning, which was Sunday, we had our breakfast together, and, as the hours passed, began to feel a little comforted. After dinner, we walked out to the field and strolled about for some time; and, when ready to go back to the house, we each took an armful of fodder along for the horses. As we laid it down and turned to go into the house, David McCoy rode up on horseback. He saw Jerry at once, and called him to come to the fence. The excitement of the last days  -  the fasting and the fear  -  had completely cowed and broken whatever of manhood, or even of brute courage, a slave might by any possibility be presumed at any time to be possessed of, and the last remains of these qualities in poor Jerry were gone. He mutely obeyed; and when, with an oath, McCoy commanded him to mount the horse behind him, he mutely seated himself there. McCoy then called to me to go to the house and bring Jerry's clothes.  Never,   -  I screamed back to him,  -   never, not to save your miserable life.  But Jerry said:  O Betty, 'tis no use. We          can't help it.  I knew this was so. I stifled my anger and my grief, brought his little bundle, into which I tucked a testament and catechism some one had given me, and shook hands   good-by  with him. So we  parted forever , in this world.      
              Much has been said about the marriage rites of slaves; but there exists no legal form,--every slaveholder  having a form of his own. Permit me, then, to give to my readers the manner in which my master performed  the ceremony. Whenever a vacancy occurred in any of the cabins of either sex, of marriageable age, it was  immediately filled up by my master purchasing another slave, either man or woman, as the case might be, and presenting them to the remaining inmates of the cabin, with the following words:  Kitty, stand out in the floor; I have bought this boy to-day for your husband, and I  shall expect you to take good care of him, by washing  and mending his clothes. You know my orders to the  overseer; if either of you go to the field on Monday  morning without your clothes being washed, you are to be  whipped. You will also take care of his provisions, which  will be weighed out with yours. Have it cooked and  ready in his bucket in time for him to go to the field  every morning. You understand what I have said to  you;  which the slave must answer with a low bow, and  replying,  I do, sir.  Then he will give the man the following charge:  Tom, you will take care of this girl  for your wife, by bringing her wood, making her fire,  bringing water. Should your wife or self want anything,  you can get it by working on Sunday, for which I will  allow you fifty cents a day, out of the store.  He would  then ask them both if they understood his orders. They  would answer as before, by a low bow and courtesy,  replying that they did. He would then pronounce them  man and wife, and say to them,  If you fail to perform  any of the duties I have mentioned, you will be flogged  severely.       
               Among the servants who worked on a distant part of the plantation, was a young man named Abram Williams. Sally was now thirteen years old, and her mistress decided that she should be married, and that this young man should be her husband. Both were her property, therefore the only part they had to play was to acquiesce in the arrangement. It happened very well in this case, but the same power could have been employed, had they disliked each other. What think you of a system which gives such unlimited control, not only over the time and labor of men and women, but over their most sacred affections? Sally had never seen him, and knew nothing about the matter, till one day, when she was in the house, her mistress said--             Well, Sally, you 're thirteen years old, and I want you to be married. There's a young man over on the plantation who'll make you a good husband. He'll come here soon, and you'll see him,  and then followed an enumeration of his good qualities.             Laws, Missis!  was the only reply Sally could make. After that she missed no opportunity to speak of him to the            simple-hearted girl, till Sally said,  'Pears like I loved him 'fore ever I saw him.  True to her word, the mistress sent for him. They were pleased with each other, as she had predicted, and as there was no reason for delaying their union, it was agreed that they should be married as soon as the hurry of the planting time was over. He was a kind, good-hearted man, and Sally was happier than she had been for a long time, in feeling that she had some one to love who would love her.            One pleasant Saturday afternoon, a few weeks after this, was fixed upon for the wedding. Work was closed early, so that the servants might participate in the festivities. Sally's scanty wardrobe had been growing less in her careful mother's absence, and now she had no decent dress for the occasion. Her mistress produced from her own stores an old white muslin. frock, and added to it a bright ribbon for her waist, and a gauze handkerchief to tie around her head. Abram was equally destitute, and his coarse field dress was exchanged for the time for some cast off clothes of his master's, which made him look, so Sally thought, quite like a gentleman. As           a special mark of favor, the Ceremony was to be performed in the house. The hour came, and with their bridemaid and groomsman they stood up before the colored Methodist preacher who was in waiting. He opened the Bible and read the account of the  marriage at Cana. Sally had never heard it before, and the thought that Jesus had been present at an earthly wedding, impressed her, more than anything had ever done, with the importance of what she was about to do. No one had ever taught her the sacredness of the marriage tie. She had heard it jested about, and had seen it lightly broken, and so it was to her rather an incident of life than one of its solemnities. But now an awe crept over her; she felt as if God were there, and  resolved, in heart, to do all in her power for her new-found friend. The reading was followed by a prayer, and then they were pronounced husband and wife. There was a momentary hush in the room. All seemed touched by the services save the master, who had  condescended to grace them with his presence, and stood leaning in the door-way, with a satirical smile upon his face. What were to him the words,  whom God hath joined together let           no man put asunder?  Did he not know that if for any reason he wished to raise a sum of money, he should separate them, and sell them, with as little feeling as he would a horse or a bushel of rice? No wonder he smiled and thought it folly! The mistress rose, and going up to the young couple, wished them much of happiness and prosperity. She was followed by all the servants in their turn, and when the congratulations were over, she led the way to the open air, where a table was set upon the lawn. It was ornamented with a handsome cake, which she herself had made, and adorned with flowers. Sally, as lady of the day, was made to sit down and pour coffee for the company. When the repast was ended, the lawn was quickly cleared for a dance, in which the mistress insisted that the newly married pair should take the lead. Sally had never danced since the camp-meeting, but they all insisted that she would not be properly married unless she did so, and she was forced to comply.  Dat was de last time I danced,  said she, in relating it;  'pears like 't want right, noway.             It was a gay party, and as evening came on, Sally's light-heartedness returned, and she           thought she had never been so happy in her life. Ah! could she have looked into the future, and seen what deepest griefs would come to her through her a  affections, what gloom would have o'ershadowed her marriage eve! The light wind in the trees would have changed to a mournful wail, and the stars that now seemed to smile, would have gazed down upon her with saddest eyes. And the birds singing good-night songs in the  sycamores above her--the happy birds who could choose their mates and live lovingly all the summer through without one fear of separation,  how would their notes have pierced her heart, could she but have looked forward!             But no  coming event cast its shadow before,  and in a merry mood the party broke up, and the servants sought their cabins.       
      CHAPTER II.              A fruitless effort for education.--The Sabbath among Slaves.-- Degrading amusements.--Why religion is rejected.--Condition of poor white people.--Superstition among slaves.--Education forbidden.              IN 1833, I had some very serious religious impressions, and there was quite a number of slaves in that neighborhood, who felt very desirous to be taught to read the Bible. There was a Miss Davis, a poor white girl, who offered to teach a Sabbath School for the slaves, notwithstanding public opinion and the law was opposed to it. Books were furnished and she commenced the school; but the news soon got to our owners that she was teaching us to read. This caused quite an excitement in the neighborhood. Patrols  *               *Police peculiar to the South.    were appointed to go and break it up the next Sabbath. They were determined that we should not have a Sabbath School in operation. For slaves this was called an incendiary Movement.             The Sabbath is not regarded by a large number of the slaves as a day of rest. They have no schools to go to; no moral nor religious instruction at all in many localities where there are hundreds of                The Sabbath among Slaves.              slaves. Hence they resort to some kind of amusement. Those who make no profession of religion, resort to the woods in large numbers on that day to gamble, fight, get drunk, and break the Sabbath. This is often encouraged by slaveholders. When they wish to have a little sport of that kind, they go among the slaves and give them whiskey, to see them dance,  pat juber,  sing and play on the banjo. Then get them to wrestling, fighting, jumping, running foot races, and butting each other like sheep. This is urged on by giving them whiskey; making bets on them; laying chips on one slave's head, and daring another to tip it off with his hand; and if he tipped it off, it be called an insult, and cause a fight. Before fighting, the parties choose their seconds to stand by them while fighting; a ring or a circle is formed to fight in, and no one is allowed to enter the ring while they are fighting, but their seconds, and the white gentlemen. They are not allowed to fight a duel, nor to use weapons any kind. The blows are made by kicking, knocking, and butting with their heads; they grab each other by their ears, and jam their heads together like sheep. If they are likely to hurt each other very bad, their masters would rap them with their walking canes, and make them stop. After fighting, they make friends, shake hands, and take a dram together, and there is no more of it.             But this is all principally for want of moral instruction. This is where they have no Sabbath Schools; no one to read the Bible to them; no one to preach the gospel who is competent to expound     
    Southerners would be the kindest people in the land. Slavery possesses the power attributed to one of old, of changing the nature of all who drink of its vicious cup.        --Which, as they taste,                     Under the influence of slavery's polluting power, the most gentle women become the fiercest viragos, and the most benevolent men are changed into inhuman monsters. It is true of the northern man who goes South also.         Whoever  tastes, loses his upright shape,                 This non-slaveholder also allowed us to catch as many fish as we pleased, and even furnished us with fishing implements. While at this mill, we became acquainted with a colored man from another part of the country; and as our desire was strong to learn how our brethren fared in other places, we questioned him respecting his treatment. He complained much of his hard fate,--said he had a wife and one child, and begged for some of our fish to carry to his wife; which my brother gladly gave him. He said he was expecting to have some money in a few days, which would be   the first he ever had in his life!   He had sent a thousand hickory-nuts to market, for which he afterwards informed us he had received thirty-six          cents, which he gave to his wife, to furnish her with some little article of comfort. This was the sum total of all the money he had ever been the possessor of! Ye northern pro-slavery men, do you regard this as robbery, or not? The whole of this man's earnings had been robbed from him during his entire life, except simply his coarse food and miserable clothing, the whole expense of which, for a plantation slave, does not exceed twenty dollars a year. This is one reason why I think every slaveholder will go to hell; for my Bible teaches me that no  thief  shall enter heaven; and I know every slaveholder is a thief; and I rather think you would all be of my opinion if you had ever been a slave. But now, assisting these thieves, and being made rich by them, you say they are not robbers; just as wicked men generally shield their abettors.            On our return from this place, we met a colored man and woman, who were very cross to each other. We inquired as to the cause of their trouble, and the man told us, that  women had such tongues!  that some of them had stolen a sheep, and this woman, after eating of it, went and told their master, and they all had to receive a severe whipping. And here follows a specimen of slaveholding morality, which will show you how much many of the masters care for their slaves' stealing. This man enjoined upon his slaves never to steal from him again, but to  steal from his neighbors,  and he would keep them from punishment, if they would furnish him with a portion of the meat! And why not? For is it any worse for the slaveholders to steal from one another, than it is to steal from their helpless slaves? Not long after, these slaves availed themselves of their master's assistance,          and stole an animal from a neighboring plantation, and according to agreement, furnished their master with his share. Soon the owner of the missing animal came rushing into the man's house, who had just eaten of the stolen food, and, in a very excited manner, demanded reparation from him, for the beast stolen, as he said, by this man's slaves. The villain, hardly able to stand after eating so bountifully of his neighbor's pork, exclaimed loudly,  my servants know no more about your hogs than I do!  which was strictly true; and the loser of the swine went away satisfied. This man told his slaves that it was a sin to steal from him, but none to steal from his neighbors! My brother told the slave we were conversing with, that it was as much of a sin in God's sight, for him to steal from one, as from the other.  Oh,  said the slave,  master says  negroes have nothing to do with God!   He further informed us that his master and mistress lived very unhappily together, on account of the maid who waited upon them. She had no husband, but had several yellow children. After we left them, they went to a fodder-stack, and took out a jug, and drank of its contents. My brother's curiosity was excited to learn the nature of their drink; and watching his opportunity, unobserved by them, he slipped up to the stack, and ascertained that the jug was nearly full of Irish whiskey. He carried it home with him, and the next time we visited the mill, he returned the jug to its former place, filled with molasses, purchased with his own money, instead of the fiery drink which it formerly contained. Some time after this, the master of this man discovered a great falling off in the supply of stolen meat furnished him by the slaves, and questioned         this man in reference to the cause of such a lamentable diminution in the supply of hog-meat in particular. The slave told him the story of the jug, and that he had ceased drinking, which was sad news for the pork-loving gentleman.            I will now return to my master's affairs. My young master's brother was a very benevolent man, and soon became convinced that it was wrong to hold men in bondage; which belief he carried into practice by emancipating forty slaves at one time, and paying the expenses of their transportation to a free state. But old master, although naturally more kind-hearted than his neighbors, could not always remain as impervious to the assaults of the pro-slavery demon; and as stated previously, that all who drank of this hateful cup were transformed into some vile animal, so he became a perfect brute in his treatment of his slaves. I cannot account for this change, only on the supposition, that experience had convinced him that kind treatment was not as well adapted to the production of crops, as a severer kind of discipline. Under the elating influence of freedom's inspiring sound, men will labor much harder, than when forced to perform unpleasant tasks, the accomplishment of which, will be of no value to themselves; but while the slave is held as such, it is difficult for him to feel as he would feel, if he was a free man, however light may be his tasks, and however kind may be his master. The lash is still held above his head, and  may  fall upon him, even if its blows are for a long time withheld. This the slave realizes; and hence no kind treatment can destroy the depressing influence of a consciousness of his being a slave,--no matter how lightly the yoke of slavery      
    recollect the sadness of her countenance, and the mournful sacredness of her words as they impressed themselves upon my youthful mind--never to be forgotten.            Mothers of the North! as you gaze upon the fair  forms of your idolised little ones, just pause for a  moment; how would you feel if you knew that at any  time the will of a tyrant--who neither could nor would  sympathise with your domestic feelings--might separate  them for ever from your embrace, not to be laid in the  silent grave  where the wicked cease from troubling  and where the weary are at rest,  but to live under the  dominion of tyrants and avaricious men, whose cold hearts cannot sympathise with your feelings, but who  will mock at any manifestation of tenderness, and  scourge them to satisfy the cruelty of their own  disposition; yet such is the condition of hundreds of  thousands of mothers in the southern states of America.            My mother used to instruct me in the principles of  morality, according to her own notion of what was good and pure; but I had no means of acquiring proper conception of  religion in a state of slavery, where all those who professed  to be followers of Jesus Christ evinced more of the  disposition of demons than of men; and it is really a matter  of wonder to me now, considering the character of my position that I did not imbibe a strong and lasting hatred  of everything pertaining to the religion of Christ. My lessons in morality were of the most simple kind. I was told not to steal, not to tell lies, and to behave myself  in a becoming manner towards everybody. My          mother, although a slave, took great delight in watching the result of her moral training in the character of my  brother and myself, whilst--whether successful or  unsuccessful in the formation of superior habits in us it is  not for me to say--there were sown for her a blissful  remembrance in the minds of her children, which will be  cherished, both by the bond and the free, as long as life shall last.            As a specimen of the religious knowledge of the slave,  I may here state what were my  impression  in regard to  my master; assuring the reader that I am not joking  but stating what were the opinions of all the slaves' children  on my  masters  plantation, so that some  judgment may be formed of the care which was taken  of our religious instruction. I really believed my old  master was Almighty God, and that the young master  was Jesus Christ! The reason of this error seems to  have been that we were taught to believe thunder to be  the voice of God, and when it was about to thunder my old master would approach us, if we were in the yard,  and say, all you children run into the house now, for it is going to thunder; and after the thunder storm was over he would approach us smilingly and say,  what a fine shower we have had,  and bidding us look at the flowers  would observe how prettily they appeared; we children seeing this so frequently, could not avoid the idea that  it was he that thundered and made the rain to fall, in order to make his flowers look beautiful, and I was nearly eight years of age before I got rid of this childish      
    for I must not be kept out of cheese much longer.  On Nancy's return to the quarters, old Ned, who was past work, and who never did anything but eat, sleep, and talk, heard the woman's explanation, and clapping his wrinkled hands exclaimed:  Well den, Nancy, you is wof moo den all de niggers on dis place, fer you gives us fresh meat ebbry day.             After getting the right runnet, and two weeks' work on the new cheese, a little, soft, sour, hard-looking thing, appearing like anything but a cheese, was exhibited at  Poplar Farm,  to the great amusement of the blacks, and the disappointment of the whites, and especially Mrs. Gaines, who had frequently remarked that her  mouth was watering for the new cheese.             No attempt was ever made afterwards to renew the cheesemaking, and the press was laid under the shed, by the side of the washing machine and the patent plow. While we had three or four trustworthy and faithful servants, it must be admitted that most of the negroes on  Poplar Farm  were always glad to shirk labor, and thought that to deceive the whites was a religious duty.            Wit and religion has ever been the negro's forte while in slavery. Wit with which to please his master, or to soften his anger when displeased, and religion to enable him to endure punishment when inflicted.            Both Dr. and Mrs. Gaines were easily deceived by their servants. Indeed, I often thought that Mrs. Gaines took peculiar pleasure in being misled     
     would be proud to have done for him.  This did not satisfy George. He was still very eager to know what it was. At length the master saw it necessary to tell George, to keep him quiet and make him attend to his duty.  Well, George, I have made provision that when you die, you shall have a good coffin, and be put into the same vault with me. Will not that satisfy you, George ?   Well, Massa, one way I am satisfied, and one way I am not.   What, what,  said the old master,  what is the matter with that?   Why,  says George,  I like to have good coffin when I die.   Well, don't you like to be in the same vault with me and other rich masters?  Why yes, master, one way I like it, and one way I don't.  Well, what don't you like?   Why I afraid, Massa, when de debbil come take you body, he make mistake, and get mine.              The slaves uniformly prefer to be buried at the greatest possible distance away from master. They are superstitious, and fear that the slave-driver having whipped so much when alive, will, somehow, be beating them when dead. I was actually as much afraid of my old master when dead as I was when he was alive. I often dreamed of him too, after he was dead, and thought he had actually come back again to torment me more.             Do you think it was right for you to run away and not pay any thing for yourself? I would be willing to pay, if I knew who to pay it to. But when I think it over, I can't find any body that has any better right to me than myself. I can't pay father and mother, for they are dead. I don't owe Mrs. Banton any thing for bringing me up the way she did. I worked five or six years, and earned more than one hundred dollars a year for Mr. K. and family,           and received about a dozen dollars a year in clothing. Who do I owe, then, in Kentucky? If I catch one of the administrators on here, I intend to sue him for wages and interest for six years' hard work. There will be a small bill of damages for abuse; old Kentucky is not rich enough to pay me for that.             Soon after you came into Ohio, did you let yourself to work? I did. Was there any difference in your feelings while laboring there, and as a slave in Kentucky?             I made a bargain to work for a man in Ohio. I took a job of digging a cellar. Before I began, the people told me he was bad pay; they would not do it for him. I told them I had agreed to do it. So at it I went, worked hard, and got it off as soon as possible, although I did not expect to get a cent for it; and yet I worked more readily and with a better mind than I ever did in Kentucky. If I worked for nothing then, I knew I had made my own bargain, and working with that thought, made it easier than any day's work I ever did for a master in Kentucky. That  thought  was worth more than any pay I ever got in slavery. However, I was more fortunate than many thought I should be; through the exertions of a good friend I got my pay soon after the work was done.             Why do slaves dread so bad to go to the South--to Mississippi or Louisiana? Because they know that slaves are driven very hard there, and worked to death in a few years.             Are those who have  good  masters afraid of being sold South? They all suffer very much for fear master's circumstances will change, and that he may be compelled to sell them to the  SOUL DRIVERS,  a name given to the dealers by the slaves.       
    George, to keep him quiet, and make him attend to  his duty.  Well, George, I have made provision  that, when you die, you shall have a good coffin, and  be put into the same vault with me. Will not that  satisfy you, George?   Well, massa, one way I am  satisfied, and one way I am not.   What, what,   said the old master,  what is the matter with that?

Why, yes, massa, one way I like it, and one way I  don't.   Well, what don't you like?   Why, I  fraid, massa, when de debbil come take you body, he make mistake, and get mine.

I was actually as much  afraid of my old master when dead, as I was when  he was alive. I often dreamed of him, too, after he  was dead, and thought he had actually come back  again, to torment me more.             Do slaves have conscientious scruples about taking things from their masters? --They think it wrong  to take from a neighbor, but not from their masters.  The only question with them is,  Can we keep it  from master?  If they can keep their backs safe,  conscience is quiet enough on this point. But a  slave that will steal from a slave, is called  mean  as   master . This is the lowest comparison slaves know  how to use:  just as mean as white folks.   No          right for to complain of white folks, who steal us all  de days of our life; nigger dat what steal from nigger,  be meaner nor all.             There is no standard of morality in the slave  states. The master stands before the slave a robber  and oppressor. His words count nothing with the  slaves. The slaves are disrobed of the attributes of  men, so that they cannot hold up the right standard,  and there is none. The slaves frequently have  discussions upon moral questions. Sol and Tom went, one night, to steal the chickens of a neighbor. Tom  went up, to hand them down to Sol. While engaged  in this operation, he paused a minute.  Sol, you  tink dis right, to steal dese chicken from here?    What dat you say, Tom?   I say, you tink him  right to steal dese chicken, Sol?   What you come  talk dat way, now, for? Dat quession you ought  settle 'fore you come here.   Me did tink about  it, but want to hear what you say, Sol. Don't you  tink it kind of wrong to take dese here chicken?    I tell you, Sol, no time for 'scuss dat now. Dat is   de  great moral question. Make haste; hand me  down anudder one; let us git away from here 'fore  de daylight come.              Do you think it was right for you to run away,  and not pay any thing for yourself? --I would be  willing to pay, if I knew who to pay it to. But when  I think it over, I can't find any body that has any  better right to me than myself. I can't pay father  and mother, for they are dead.

There will be a small bill of damages for abuse; old  Kentucky is not rich enough to pay me for that.

Are those who have GOOD masters afraid of being sold south? --They all suffer very much for fear       
      before him. On the dispersion of the Africans, it fell to his  lot to be put on board the British brig  Peacock  as a cabin  boy, and that vessel soon after sailed on a cruise. The Dr.  Southsides, perhaps, will think that it was only returning  him into the true path of providential redemption that this  happened to be the cruise in which the  Peacock  fell in with  the American schooner  Hornet,  and in the memorable naval  battle which followed that encounter she struck her flag to  Captain Lawrence. Tallen or, as he was now called, John Bull,  a second time in his short career a prisoner of war, was  brought to this country.              Here he fell in charge of Lieut. (afterwards President)  William Henry Harrison, and for some unexplained reason, was  taken to Savannah, Ga. In that city he was left with Judge  Charlton, until he should be ordered to Washington, to be  disposed of with the other prisoners, the crew of the   Peacock.  Judge Charlton proposed to  Lient.  Harrison that he  should leave the boy with him to be brought up, but this the  Lieutenant declined, as being a prisoner he was not within  his control. Two months subsequently he sent to the Judge for  his charge, and received for answer that the boy had died of  the fever. Such was the statement made to John Bull by an old  servant of Judge Charlton, named Isaac, and subsequent events  seem to verify it.              The Lieutenant, John Bull never new or heard from, again;  but at about the time that he must, if the statement be true,  have been sent for to go to Washington, and when the Judge  returned him as dead of fever, he--the Judge--called  together his servants, and announced to them that it was his  pleasure that hereafter the boy should no longer be known as  'John Bull,' but thence forward be called by that same which  belonged to himself; and he incited them to remember his  orders by that incentive which slaveholders usually supply to  their slaves--the threat of the cowhide. Thereafter 'John  Bull' was known only as Dimmock Charlton, and by that name he  has gone ever since.              As Judge Charlton was, during his lifetime, a very well  known person, a man of high standing and great respectability,  a lawyer of some eminence, an author of one or two law books,  and one against whom we, at least, never heard any thing  worse than that he published a volume of most dreary rhymes,  it may seem incredible that he could be guilty of so  despicable a crime as is here laid to his charge.  *                *Judge  Charlton was very intemperate.    But we must remember that the  act is to be measured by the code of slaveholding morality,  and not by that which obtains in more civilized communities.  It might, indeed, be argued that man who steal men from  themselves--the original owners--would not be very  scrupulous in stealing from each other, were it not that the  universal principle of 'honor among thieves' would operate as  a sufficient restraint in a state of society where its  infringement would lead to the wildest confusion. But in the  case of this 'John Bull' there need enter no such  consideration. He, according to the code which  provails  among  our Southern brethren, belonged to nobody--was a mere waif  and  estray  which the fortunes or war had landed upon our  shores, from the coast of Africa, and anybody might pick it  up who would be at the trouble. Some consideration, perhaps,  might be due to Lieutenant Harrison, but he had no claim upon  the property, as property, but simply upon the man as a  prisoner. If discharged of his duty to him, in that regard,  he had nothing further to do with him; and if persuaded of  the truth of that convenient fiction, that the boy was dead,  all remonstrance from him would be avoided; Judge Charlton  would, in an easy way, be so much the richer, to the value of  this particular piece of goods; nobody would lose anything  except the Government, whose loss of a prisoner, who might be  a burthen, would be a gain, and the poor boy himself would  have somebody to take care of him. So, perhaps, reasoned the  Judge; so, at least, only could he reason to any sort of  self-justification. At any rate, he took care of the poor  African by giving him his own name, and selling him the next  day to a Frenchman.       
   preceding; and Burmey's son went to Rogers and they fought about the matter. Law ensued, which cost Rogers 800 dollars, Burmey 600 dollars and his face disfigured; and my master's wife came in for a deal of scandal, which caused further proceedings at law, costing the master 1400 hundred dollars, and I was never once suspected or charged with the deed.           At this time two or three negroes had escaped, and I heard so much about the free States of the north that I was determined to be free. So I began to study what we call the north star, or astronomy, to guide me to the free States. I was in the habit of driving the master; and on one occasion I had to drive him to Baltimore where two of his sons were studying law; and while there, I stole some sweet potatoes to roast when I got home; and how master got to know I had them I never knew; but when I got home he gave me a note to Mr. Cobb, the overseer, and told me to tell Dick, (another slave on the plantation) to come to Baltimore to him on the following evening, and as soon as I took the note in my hand I was certain there was a flogging in it for me, though he said nothing to me. I held the note that night and following day, afraid to give it to Mr. Cobb, so confidant was I of what would be the result. Towards evening I began to reason thus--If I give Cobb the note I shall be whipped; if I  withold  the note from him I shall be whipped, so a whipping appears plain in either case. Now Dick having arranged to meet his sweetheart this night assumed sickness, so that he could have an excuse for not meeting master at Baltimore, and he wanted me to go instead of him. I agreed to go, providing he would take the note I had to Mr. Cobb, as I had forgot to give it him, to which he consented, and off went; and I heard that when he delivered the note to Mr. Cobb, he ordered him to go to the whipping-post, and when he asked what he had done he was knocked down, and afterwards put to the post and thirty-nine lashes were administered, and failed seeing his sweetheart as well. When I arrived at Baltimore my master and young master took their seats and I drove away without any question until we had gone three miles, when he asked what I was doing there that night. I very politely said Dick was not well, and I had come in his place. He then asked me if Mr. Cobb got his note, I answered, yes, sir. He then asked me how I felt, and I said first rate, sir.  The d--l you do,  said he. I said, yes sir. He said  nigger, did Mr. Cobb flog you?  No sir. I have done nothing wrong.  You never do,  he answered; and said no more until he got        home. Being a man who could not bear to have any order of his disobeyed or unfulfilled, he immediately called for Mr. Cobb, and was told he was in bed; and when he appeared, the master asked if he got the note sent by the nigger. Mr. Cobb said  Yes   Then why,  said master,  did you not perform my orders in the note?   I did, sir,  replied Cobb; when the master said,  I told you to give that nigger thirty-nine lashes,  Mr. Cobb says,  So I did, sir;  when master replied,  He says you never licked him at all.  Upon which Cobb said,  He is a liar:  when my master called for me (who had been hearing the whole dialogue at the door), I turned on my toes and went a short distance, and I shouted with a loud voice that I was coming, (to prevent them knowing that I had been listening) and appeared before them and said  here I am master, do you want me.  He said  Yes. Did you not tell me that Mr. Cobb had not flogged you,  and I said  yes I did; he has not flogged me to-day, sir.  Mr. Cobb answered,  I did not flog him. You did not tell me to flog him. You told me to flog that other nigger.   What other nigger,  enquired Master. Cobb said,  Dick.  Master then said,  I did not, I told you to flog this nigger here,  Cobb then produced the letter, and read it as follows:            Mr. Cobb will give the bearer 39 lashes on delivery.            R. T. EARLE.           I then left the room and explanations took place. When I was again called in.  How came Dick to have had the letter,  and I then said I had forgot to deliver it until Dick wanted me to go to Baltimore in his place, and I agreed providing he would take the letter. Master then said  you lie, you infernal villain,  and laid hold of a pair of tongs and said he would dash my brains out if I did not tell him the truth. I then said I thought there was something in the note that boded no good to me, and I did not intend to give it to him. He said,  you black vagabond, stay on this plantation three months longer, and you will be master and I the slave; no wonder you said you felt first rate when I asked you, but I will sell you to go to Georgia the first chance I get.  Then laying the tongs down he opened the door and ordered me out. I knew he had on heavy cow-hide boots, and I knew he would try to assist me in my outward progress, and though expecting it, and went as quick as I could, I was materially assisted by a heavy kick from my master's foot. This did not end the matter, for when Dick found out I had caused his being flogged, we had continual fightings for several months.     
    will go; and after a great deal of coaxing and flattering, I finally consented to go, for which I have many a time and often heartily repented. He then went to my master and I followed him. He told him that I had consented to go. My master said he would not force me to go, but if I was willing he would consent to it. Mr. A--, (for that was my new masters name, who was a Jew) then paid him five hundred dollars. Doct. Thornton, then ordered his horse up: he would not stay to see me start, but bade me good bye, and rode off with tears in his eyes. I then started with my new master for Savannah, with a carriage and four horses: we travelled about twelve miles the first  day. I was dissatisfied with him before I had got two miles. We travelled the next day twenty five miles, as far as Petersburgh. I was so much dissatisfied with him, that I offered a black man at that place, two silver dollars to take an axe and break my leg, in order that I could not go on to Savannah; but he refused, saying he could tell me a better way. I asked him how? He said runaway.  I  told him  I  would not run away unless  I  was sure of gaining my freedom by doing it. We then travelled on the next day about thirty miles, and put up for the night.  I  then attempted to break my leg myself. Accordingly  I  took up an axe, and laying my leg on a log,  I  struck at it several times with an axe endeavouring to break it, at the same time  I  put up my fervent prayers to God to be my guide, saying,  if it be thy will that  I  break my leg in order that  I  may not go on to Georgia, grant that my blows may take effect; but thy will not mine be done.  Finding  I  could not hit my leg after a number of fruitless attempts,  I  was convinced by my feelings then, that God had not left me in my sixth trouble, and would be with me in the seventh. Accordingly  I  tried no more to destroy myself.  I  then prayed to God, that if it was his will that  I  should go, that  I  might willingly. My old master and mistress in Virginia, had often  threatned  to sell me to the negro buyer from Georgia, for any trifling offence, and in order to make me dislike to go there, they would tell me  I  should have to eat cotton seed, and make indigo, and not have corn bread to eat as  I  did in Virginia. The next day we went as far as Columbia, in South Carolina. This was Saturday evening.            I was quite fatigued, and after taking care of the horses, I laid myself down in the stable to rest. I soon fell asleep, and slept for an hour or two. My master missing me, and thinking I had run away, made a thorough search for me, but could not find me until I awoke and went into the      
    at work in his yard. One of them was a man about my size, and resembling me very much in dress, being dressed in a blue roundabout jacket. He came into the yard to his work one morning, with an umbrella in his hand. This old woman saw him come in, and thinking it was me, or pretending so to do, was the cause of my receiving a severe whipping, in the following manner. My master having mislaid his umbrella, had been looking for it for some time, and on inquiring of her about it, she told him that she saw me come into the yard with it in my hand. I was then in the yard; he called to me, and said, where have you been, sir? I replied, only to work about the yard, sir. He then asked me where I was all night with his umbrella? I told him I had not been out of the yard, nor had I seen his umbrella. He said I was a liar, and that I had taken his umbrella away, and was seen to return with it in my hand this morning when coming into the yard. I told him it was not so, and that I knew nothing about it. He immediately fell foul of me with a large stick, and beat me most unmercifully, until I really thought he would kill me. I begged of him to desist as I was perfectly innocent. He not believing me, still continued to beat me, until his strength was entirely exhausted. Some time after this, my mistress found his umbrella where she had placed it herself, having removed it from the place where he had left it, and gave it to him, saying, you have beat him for nothing--he was innocent of it. I was afterwards informed by another servant of the circumstance. I then went to my master, and told him that he had beaten me most unmercifully for a crime I was not guilty of, all through the insinuation of that old woman. He replied,  No, by Gad, I never hit you a blow amiss: if you did not deserve it now, you did some other time.  I told him she must have been drunk or she would not have told him such a story. He said that could not be, as she never was allowed to have any liquor by her. I told him to look in her chest, and convince himself. He then inquired of her if she had any rum. She said, no, sir, I have not a drop. I then told         him that if he would look in her chest he would find it. He accordingly went, and found it. He then said to her, hey, you old bitch, I have caught you in a lie. On this same account she appeared to be determined to kill me, by some means or other. I slept in the same room with her, under the kitchen. My blankets were on the floor. She had a straw bed on a bedstead about four paces from mine. My master slept directly over my head. I have heretofore stated that I was convinced that this creature was a witch, and would turn herself into almost any different shape she chose. I have at different times of the night felt a singular sensation, such as people generally call the night-mare. I would feel her coming towards me, and endeavoring to make a noise, which I could do quite plainly at first; but the nearer she approached me the more faintly I would cry out. I called to her, aunt Frankee! aunt Frankee! as plain as I could, until she got upon me and began to exercise her enchantments on me. I was then entirely speechless, making a noise like one apparently choking or strangling. My master had often heard me make this noise in the night, and had called to me, to know what was the matter; but as long as she remained there I could not answer. She would then leave me and go to her own bed. After my master had called to her a number, of times, Frankee! Frankee! what ails Theo? (a name I went by there, cutting short the name Theodore,) she answered, hag ride him, sair. He then called to me, telling me to go and sleep with her. I could then, after she had left me, speak myself, and also have use of my limbs. I got up and went to her bed, and tried to get under her coverlid; but not find her. I found her bedclothes wet. I kept feeling for her, but could not find her. Her bed was tumbled from head to foot. I was then convinced she was a witch, and that she rode me. I then lay across the corner of her bed without any covering, because I thought she would not dare to ride me on her own bed, although she was a witch. I have often, at the time she started from her own bed, in some shape or other, felt a shock,     
    them, and the consideration which I had always manifested for them.            Under these circumstances no difficulty arose from want of submission to my authority, and none of any sort, except that which I necessarily encountered from my ignorance of the country, and my inexperience in such business. On arriving at Wheeling, I sold the horse and wagon, and purchased a boat of sufficient size, and floated down the river without further trouble or fatigue, stopping every night to encamp.            I said I had no further trouble, but there was one source of anxiety which I was compelled to encounter, and a temptation I had to resist, the strength of which others can appreciate as well as myself. In passing along the State of Ohio, we were frequently told that we were free, if we chose to be so. At Cincinnati, especially, the colored people gathered round us, and urged us with much importunity to remain with them; told us it was folly to go on; and in short used all the arguments now so familiar to induce slaves to quit their masters. My companions probably had little perception of the nature of the boon that was offered to them, and were willing to do just as I told them, without a wish to judge for themselves. Not so with me. From my earliest recollection, freedom had been the object of my ambition, a constant motive to exertion, an ever-present stimulus to gain and to save. No other means of obtaining it, however, had occurred to          me, but purchasing myself of my master. The idea of running away was not one that I had ever indulged. I had a sentiment of honor on the subject, or what I thought such, which I would not have violated even for freedom; and every cent which I had ever felt entitled to call my own, had been treasured up for this great purpose, till I had accumulated between thirty and forty dollars. Now was offered to me an opportunity I had not anticipated. I might liberate my family, my companions, and myself, without the smallest risk, and without injustice to any individual, except one whom we had none of us any reason to love, who had been guilty of cruelty and oppression to us all for many years, and who had never shown the smallest symptom of sympathy with us, or with any one in our condition. But I need not make the exception. There would have been no injustice to R. himself--it would have been a retribution which might be called righteous--if I had availed myself of the opportunity thus thrust suddenly upon me.            But it was a punishment which it was not for me to inflict. I had promised that man to take his property to Kentucky, and deposit it with his brother; and this, and this only, I resolved to do. I left Cincinnati before night, though I had intended to remain there, and encamped with my entire party a few miles below the city. What advantages I may have lost, by thus throwing away an opportunity of obtaining freedom, I          know not; but the perception of my own strength of character, the feeling of integrity, the sentiment of high honor, I have experienced,--these advantages I do know, and prize; and would not lose them, nor the recollection of having attained them, for all that I can imagine to have resulted from an earlier release from bondage. I have often had painful doubts as to the propriety of my carrying so many other individuals into slavery again, and my consoling reflection has been, that I acted as I thought at the time was best.            I arrived at Daviess county, Kentucky, about the middle of April, 1825, and delivered myself and my companions to Mr. Amos R., the brother of my owner, who had a large plantation, with from eighty to one hundred negroes. His house was situated about five miles south of the Ohio River, and fifteen miles above the Yellow Banks, on Big Blackford's Creek. There I remained three years, expecting my master to follow; and employed meantime on the farm, of which I had the general management, in consequence of the recommendation for ability and honesty which I brought with me from Maryland. The situation was in many respects more comfortable than that I had left. The farm was larger, and more fertile, and there was a greater abundance of food, which is, of course, one of the principal sources of the comfort of a slave, debarred, as he is, from so many enjoyments which other men can obtain.      
      sharing with him the food I took care to provide for my own family. He is still living, and, I understand, one of the wealthiest men in Washington city.             After a time, however, continual dissipation was more than a match for domestic saving. My master fell into difficulty, and from difficulty into a lawsuit with a brother-in-law, who charged him with dishonesty in the management of property confided to him in trust. The lawsuit was protracted enough to cause his ruin of itself.             Harsh and tyrannical as my master had been, I really pitied him in his present distress. At times he was dreadfully dejected, at others crazy with drink and rage. Day after day would he ride over to Montgomery Court House about his business, and every day his affairs grew more desperate. He would come into my cabin to tell me how things were going, but spent the time chiefly in lamenting his misfortunes and cursing his brother-in-law. I tried to comfort him as best I could. He had confidence in my fidelity and judgment,           and partly through pride, partly through that divine spirit of love I had learned to worship in Jesus, I entered with interest into all his perplexities. The poor, drinking, furious, moaning creature was utterly incapable of managing his affairs. Shiftlessness, licentiousness and drink had complicated them as much as actual dishonesty.             One night in the month of January, long after I had fallen asleep, he came into my cabin and waked me up. I thought it strange, but for a time he said nothing and sat moodily warming himself at the fire. Then he began to groan and wring his hands.  Sick, massa?  said I. He made no reply but kept on moaning.  Can't I help you any way, massa?  I spoke tenderly, for my heart was full of compassion at his wretched appearance. At last, collecting himself, he cried,  Oh, Sie! I'm ruined, ruined, ruined!   How so, massa?   They've got judgment against me, and in less than two weeks every nigger I've got will be put up and sold.  Then he burst into a storm of curses at his           brother-in-law. I sat silent, powerless to utter a word. Pity for him and terror at the anticipation of my own family's future fate filled my heart.  And now, Sie,  he continued,  there's only one way I can save anything. You can do it; won't you, won't you?  In his distress he rose and actually threw his arms around me. Misery had levelled all distinctions.  If I can do it, massa, I will. What is it?  Without replying he went on,  won't you, won't you? I raised you, Sie; I made you overseer; I know I've abused you, Sie, but I didn't mean it.  Still he avoided telling me what he wanted.  Promise me you'll do it, boy.  He seemed resolutely bent on having my promise first, well knowing from past experience that what I agreed to do I spared no pains to accomplish. Solicited in this way, with urgency and tears, by the man whom I had so zealously served for over thirty years, and who now seemed absolutely dependent upon his slave,--impelled, too, by the fear which he skilfully awakened, that the sheriff would seize every one who belonged to           him, and that all would be separated, or perhaps sold to go to Georgia, or Louisiana--an object of perpetual dread to the slave of the more northern States--I consented, and promised faithfully to do all I could to save him from the fate impending over him.             At last the proposition came.  I want you to run away, Sie, to your master Amos in Kentucky, and take all the servants along with you.  I could not have been more startled had he asked me to go to the moon. Master Amos was his brother.  Kentucky, massa? Kentucky? I don't know the way.   O, it's easy enough for a smart fellow like you to find it; I'll give you a pass and tell you just what to do.  Perceiving that I hesitated, he endeavored to frighten me by again referring to the terrors of being sold to Georgia.             For two or three hours he continued to urge the undertaking, appealing to my pride, my sympathies, and my fears, and at last, appalling as it seemed, I told him I would do my best. There were eighteen negroes, besides my wife, two children and myself, to transport           nearly a thousand miles, through a country about which I knew nothing, and in mid-winter--for it was the month of February, 1825. My master proposed to follow me in a few months, and establish himself in Kentucky.             My mind once made up, I set earnestly about the needful preparations. They were few and easily made. A one-horse wagon, well stocked with oats, meal, bacon, for our own and the horse's support, was soon made ready. My pride was aroused in view of the importance of my responsibility, and heart and soul I became identified with my master's project of running off his negroes. The second night after the scheme was formed we were under way. Fortunately for the success of the undertaking, these people had long been under my direction, and were devotedly attached to me in return for the many alleviations I had afforded to their miserable condition, the comforts I had procured them, and the consideration I had always manifested for them. Under these circumstances no difficulty arose from want of submission to my authority.           The dread of being separated, and sold away down south, should they remain on the old estate, united them as one man, and kept them patient and alert.             We started from home about eleven o'clock at night, and till the following noon made no permanent halt. The men trudged on foot, the children were put into the wagon, and now and then my wife rode for a while. On we went through Alexandria, Culpepper, Fauquier, Harper's Ferry, Cumberland, over the mountains on the National Turnpike, to Wheeling. In all the taverns along the road were regular places for the droves of negroes continually passing along under the system of the internal slave trade. In these we lodged, and our lodging constituted our only expense, for our food we carried with us. To all who asked questions I showed my master's pass, authorizing me to conduct his negroes to Kentucky, and often was the encomium of  smart nigger  bestowed on me, to my immense gratification.             At the places where we stopped for the           night, we often met negro-drivers with their droves, who were almost uniformly kept chained to prevent them from running away. The inquiry was often propounded to me by the drivers,  Whose niggers are those?  On being informed, the next inquiry usually was,  Where are they going?   To Kentucky.   Who drives them?   Well, I have charge of them,  was my reply.  What a smart nigger!  was the usual exclamation, with an oath.  Will your master sell you? Come in and stop with us.  In this way I was often invited to pass the evening with them in the bar-room; their negroes, in the meantime, lying chained in the pen, while mine were scattered around at liberty.             Arriving at Wheeling, in pursuance of the plan laid down by my master, I sold the horse and wagon, and purchased a large boat, called in that region a yawl. Our mode of locomotion was now decidedly more agreeable than tramping along day after day, at the rate we had kept up ever since leaving home. Very little labor at the oars was necessary. The           tide floated us steadily along, and we had ample leisure to sleep and recruit our strength.             A new and unexpected trouble now assailed me. On passing along the Ohio shore, we were repeatedly told by persons conversing with us, that we were no longer slaves, but free men, if we chose to be so. At Cincinnati, especially, crowds of colored people gathered round us, and insisted on our remaining with them. They told us we were fools to think of going on and surrendering ourselves up to a new owner; that now we could be our own masters, and put ourselves out of all reach of pursuit. I saw the people under me were getting much excited. Divided counsels and signs of insubordination began to manifest themselves. I began, too, to feel my own resolution giving way. Freedom had ever been an object of my ambition, though no other means of obtaining it had occurred to me but purchasing myself. I had never dreamed of running away. I had a sentiment of honor on the subject. The duties of the slave to his master as appointed over           him in the Lord, I had ever heard urged by ministers and religious men. It seemed like outright stealing. And now I felt the devil was getting the upper hand of me. Strange as all this may seem, I really felt it then. Entrancing as the idea was, that the coast was clear for a run for freedom, that I might liberate my companions, might carry off my wife and children, and some day own a house and land, and be no longer despised and abused--still my notions of right were against it. I had promised my master to take his property to Kentucky, and deposit it with his brother Amos. Pride, too, came in to confirm me. I had undertaken a great thing; my vanity had been flattered all along the road by hearing myself praised; I thought it would be a feather in my cap to carry it through thoroughly; and had often painted the scene in my imagination of the final surrender of my charge to master Amos, and the immense admiration and respect with which he would regard me.             Under the influence of these impressions,           and seeing that the allurements of the crowd were producing a manifest effect, I sternly assumed the captain, and ordered the boat to be pushed off into the stream. A shower of curses followed me from the shore; but the negroes under me, accustomed to obey, and, alas! too degraded and ignorant of the advantages of liberty to know what they were forfeiting, offered no resistance to my command.             Often since that day has my soul been pierced with bitter anguish at the thought of having been thus instrumental in consigning to the infernal bondage of slavery so many of my fellow-beings. I have wrestled in prayer with God for forgiveness. Having experienced myself the sweetness of liberty, and knowing too well the after misery of numbers of many of them, my infatuation has seemed to me the unpardonable sin. But I console myself with the thought that I acted according to my best light, though the light that was in me was darkness. Those were my days of ignorance. I knew not the glory           of free manhood. I knew not that the title-deed of the slave-owner is robbery and outrage.             What advantages I may have personally lost by thus throwing away an opportunity of obtaining freedom, I know not; but the perception of my own strength of character, the feeling of integrity, the sentiment of high honor, I thus gained by obedience to what I believed right, these advantages I do know and prize. He that is faithful over a little, will alone be faithful over much. Before God, I tried to do my best, and the error of judgment lies at the door of the degrading system under which I had been nurtured.      
       drinking, furious, shiftless, moaning creature was utterly incapable of managing his affairs.             One night in the month of January, long after I had fallen asleep, he came into my cabin and waked me up. I thought it strange, but for a time he said nothing, and sat moodily warming himself at the fire. Then he began to groan and wring his hands.  Sick, massa?  said I. He made no reply, but kept on moaning.  Can't I help you any way, massa?  I spoke tenderly, for my heart was full of compassion at his wretched appearance.

I sat silent, powerless to utter a word.  Pity for him and terror at the anticipation of my own family's future fate filled my heart.  And now, Sie,  he continued,  there's only one way I can save anything. You can do it; won't you, won't you?  In his distress he rose and actually threw his arms around me. Misery had levelled all  distinctions.  If I can do it, massa, I will. What is it?  Without replying he went on,  Won't you, won't you? I raised you, Sie; I made you  overseer; I know I have abused you, Sie, but I didn't mean it.  Still he avoided telling me what he wanted.  Promise me you'll do it, boy.  He seemed  resolutely bent on having my promise first, well  knowing from past experience, that what I agreed to do I spared no pains to accomplish. Solicited in this way,             with urgency and tears, by the man whom I had so zealously served for over thirty years, and who now seemed absolutely dependent upon his slave; impelled, too, by the fear which he skilfully awakened, that the sheriff would seize every one who belonged to him, and that all would be separated, or perhaps sold to go to Georgia, or Louisiana--an object of perpetual dread to the slave of the more northern States--I consented, and promised faithfully to do all I could to save him from the fate impending over him.             At last the proposition came.  I want you to run away, Sie, to my brother Amos in Kentucky, and take all the servants along with you.  I could not have been more startled had he asked me to go to the moon.  Kentucky, massa? Kentucky? I don't know the way.   Oh, it's easy enough for a smart fellow like you to find it; I'll give you a pass and tell you just what to do.  Perceiving that I hesitated, he endeavoured to frighten me by again referring to the terrors of being sold and taken to Georgia.             For two or three hours he continued to urge the undertaking, appealing to my pride, my sympathies, and my fears, and at last, appalling as it seemed, I told  him I would do my best. There were eighteen negroes, besides my wife, two children, and myself to transport nearly a thousand miles, through a country about which I knew nothing, and in midwinter, for it was the month of February, 1825. My master proposed to follow me in a few months, and establish himself in Kentucky.                       My mind once made up, I set earnestly about the needful preparations. They were few and easily made. A one-horse waggon, well-stocked with oats, meal, and bacon, for our own and the horse's support, was soon made ready. My pride was aroused in view of the importance of my responsibility, and heart and soul I became identified with my master's project of running off his negroes. The second night after the scheme was formed, we were under way. Fortunately for the success of the undertaking, these people had long been under my direction, and were devotedly attached to me in return for the many alleviations I had afforded to their miserable condition, the comforts I had procured them, and the consideration I had always manifested for them. Under these circumstances, no difficulty arose from want of submission to my authority. The dread of being separated, and sold away down south, should they remain on the old estate, united them as one man, and kept them patient and alert.             We started from home about eleven o'clock at night, and till the following noon made no permanent halt. The men trudged on foot, the children were put into the wagon, and now and then my wife rode for a while. On we went through Alexandria, Culpepper, Fauquier, Harper's Ferry, Cumberland, over the mountains on the National Turnpike to Wheeling. In all the taverns along the road there were regular places for the droves of negroes who were continually passing through the country under the care of overseers. In these we lodged, and our lodging constituted our only expense, for our              food we carried with us. To all who asked questions I showed my master's pass, authorising me to  conduct his negroes to Kentucky, and often was the encomium of  smart nigger  bestowed on me, to my immense gratification.             At the place where we stopped for the night, we often met negro-drivers with their droves, who were almost uniformly kept chained to prevent them from running away. The inquiry was often propounded to me by the drivers,  Whose niggers are those?  On being informed, the next inquiry usually was,  Where are they going?   To Kentucky.   Who drives them?   Well, I have charge of them,  was my reply.  What a smart nigger!  was the usual exclamation, with an oath.  Will your master sell you? Come in and stop with us.  In this way I was often invited to pass the evening with them in the bar-room; their negroes, in the meantime, lying chained in the pen, while mine were scattered around at liberty.             Arriving at Wheeling, in pursuance of the plan laid down by my master, I sold the horse and waggon, and purchased a large boat, called in that region, a yawl. Our mode of locomotion was now decidedly more agreeable than tramping along day after day at the rate we had kept up ever since leaving home. Very little labour at the oars was necessary. The tide floated us steadily along, and we had ample leisure to sleep and recruit our strength.             A new and unexpected trouble now assailed me. On passing along the Ohio shore, we were repeatedly told by persons conversing with us that we were no longer slaves but free men, if we chose to be so. At             Cincinnati, especially, crowds of coloured people gathered round us, and insisted on our remaining with them. They told us we were fools to think of going on and surrendering ourselves up to a new owner; that now we could be our own masters, and put ourselves out of all reach of pursuit. I saw that the people under me were getting much excited. Divided counsels and signs of insubordination began to manifest themselves. I began, too, to feel my own resolution giving way. Freedom had ever been an object of my ambition, though no other means of obtaining it had occurred to me but purchasing myself. I had never dreamed of running away. I had a sentiment of honour on the subject. The duties of the slave to his master as appointed over him in the Lord, I had ever heard urged by ministers and religious men. Entrancing as the ideas were, that the coast was clear for a run for freedom, that I might liberate my companions, might carry off my wife and children, and some day own a house and land, and be no longer despised and abused, still my notions of right were against it. I had promised my master to take his property to Kentucky, and deposit it with his brother Amos. Pride, too, came in to confirm me. I had undertaken a great thing; my vanity had been flattered all along the road by hearing myself praised; I thought it would be a feather in my cap to carry it through thoroughly, and had often painted the scene in my imagination of the final surrender of my charge to Master Amos, and the immense admiration and respect with which he would regard me.             Under the influence of these impressions, and             seeing that the allurements of the crowd were producing a manifest effect, I sternly assumed the captain, and ordered the boat to be pushed off into the stream. A shower of curses followed me from the shore; but the negroes under me, accustomed to obey, and, alas! too degraded and ignorant of the advantages of liberty to know what they were forfeiting, offered no resistance to my command.             Often since that day has my soul been pierced with bitter anguish, at the thought of having been thus instrumental in consigning to the infernal bondage of slavery, so many of my fellow-beings. I have wrestled in prayer with God for forgiveness. Having experienced myself the sweetness of liberty, and knowing too well the after-misery of a number of these slaves, my infatuation has often seemed to me to have been the unpardonable sin. But I console myself with the thought that I acted according to my best light, though the light  that was in me was darkness. Those were my days of  ignorance. I knew not then the glory of free manhood, or  that the title-deed of the slave-owner is robbery and  outrage.             What advantages I may have personally lost by thus throwing away an opportunity of obtaining freedom! But the perception of my own strength of character, the feeling of integrity, the sentiment of high honour, I thus gained by obedience to what I believed right, are advantages which I prize. He that is faithful over a little, will be faithful over much. Before God I tried to do my best, and the error of judgment lies at the door of the degrading system under which I had been nurtured.        
     wanted me to choose one of two of his intimate friends as my master. He named the two friends and I chose Col. R. M. Johnston, with whom I lived until the emancipation  of the slaves. As he was a very kind man to his slaves, I remained on the plantation with him one year after the emancipation. From the fall of 1857 until the emancipation I was his house servant, and looked after his domestic interests in general. He had great  confidence in me and trusted me with money and other  valuables. In all things I was honest and true to him and his interests. Though young, I felt as much interest in his well-being as I have felt since in my own. I made it a special point never to lie to him or deceive him in any way. I felt that I could not afford to be false even to those who appeared to be my enslavers and oppressors,  and I have never regretted this course in after years. The training that I received in the narrow house of slavery has been a minister of correction and mercy to me in all these years of struggle, trial, labor, and anxiety. I have no complaint against American slavery. It was a blessing in disguise to me and to many. It has made the negro race what it could not have been in its native land. Slavery was but a circumstance or a link in the transitions of humanity, and must have its greatest  bearing upon the future.            Col. Johnston, my last owner, had an interesting family of seven brilliant children and a brilliant wife. For  them I have the best wishes and the highest esteem.            In 1867-68 I cultivated a cotton farm in Hancock  county, Ga., on rented land. My wife and I labored to  make an honest living. Assisted by two young men  whom I hired, I made a competent living. My house was  built of skinned pine poles and contained two large  rooms and a hall. It was so constructed that every part  of the spacious building had windows, so that I was out  of doors while I was in doors. In my humble palace on  a hill in the woods beneath the shade of towering pines     
      able to move the minds, of other men by my thoughts. It seemed to me now, that, if I could learn to read and write, this learning might  --   nay, I really thought it would, point out to me the way to freedom, influence, and real, secure happiness. So, I hurried on to my master's store, and, watching my opportunity to do it, safe from curious eyes, I hid my book with the utmost care, under some liquor barrels in the smokehouse. The first opportunity I improved to examine it. I looked it over with the most intense eagerness, turned over its leaves, and tried to discover  what the new and strange  chracters  which I saw in its pages might mean. But I found it a vain endeavor. I could understand a picture, and from it make out a story of immediate  interest to my mind. But I could not associate any thought or fact with these crooked letters with which my  primmer  was filled. So the next day I sought a favorable moment, and asked James to tell me where a scholar must begin in order to learn to read, and how. He laughed at my Ignorance, and, taking his spelling-book, showed me the alphabet in large and small letters on the same page. I asked him the name of the first letter, pointing it out, he told me A; so of the next, and so on through the alphabet. I managed to remember A and B, and I studied and looked out the same letters in many other parts of the book. And so I fixed in a tenacious memory the names of the two first letters of the alphabet. But I found I could not get on without help, and so I applied to James again to show me the letters and tell me their names. This time he suspected me of trying to learn to read myself, and he plied me with questions till he ascertained that I was, in good earnest, entering upon an effort to get knowledge. At this discovery, he manifested a good deal of indignation. He told me, in scorn, that it was not for such as  me  to try to improve, that I was a  slave , and that it was not proper for  me  to learn to read. He threatened to tell my master, and at length, by his hard language, my anger was fully aroused, and I answered taunt with taunt. He called me a poor, miserable nigger; and I called him a poor, ignorant servant boy. While we were engaged in loud and angry words, of mutual defiance and scorn, my master came into the store. Mr. Jones had never given me a whipping since the time I have already described, during my first year of toil, want and suffering in his  service. But he had now caught me in the unpardonable offence of giving  saucy language to a white boy, and one, too, who was in his employ.  Without stopping to make any inquiries, he took down the cow-hide,  and gave me a severe whipping. He told me never to talk back to a white man on pain of flogging. I suppose this law or custom is universal at           the south. And I suppose it is thought necessary to enforce  ths  habit of obsequious submission on the parts of the colored people to the whites, in order to maintain their supremacy over the poor, outraged slaves.             I will mention, in this connection, as illustrative of this cruel custom, an incident which I saw just before I ran away from my chains. A little colored boy was carrying along through Wilmington a basket of food. His name was Ben, and he belonged to Mrs. Runkin, a widow lady. A little mischievous white boy, just about Ben's age and size, met him, and purposely overturned the little fellow's basket, and scattered his load in the mud. Ben, in return for this wanton act called him some hard name, when the white boy clinched him to throw him down with the scattered fragments upon his basket in the mud. Ben resisted and threw down the white boy, proving to be the stronger of the two. Tom Myers, a young lawyer of Wilmington, saw the contest, and immediately rushing out, seized little Ben, and dragged him into the store opposite the place of battle. He sent out to a saddler's shop, procured a cow-hide, and gave the little fellow a tremendous flogging, for the daring crime of resisting a white boy who had wantonly invaded his rights. Is it any wonder that the spirit of self-respect of the poor, ignorant slave is broken down by such treatment of unsparing and persevering cruelty?             I was now repulsed by James, so that I could hope for no assistance  from him in learning to read. But I could not go on alone. I must get some one to aid me in starting, or give up the effort to learn. This I could not bear to do. I thought of a little boy, Hiram Bricket, ten years old, or about that age, who came along by the store one day, on his way home from school, while my master was gone home to dinner, and James was in the front part of the store. I beckoned to Hiram to come round to the back door; and with him I made a bargain to meet me each day at noon, when I was allowed a little while to get my dinner, and to give me instruction in reading. I was to give him six cents a week. I met him the next day at his father's stable, the place agreed upon for our daily meeting; and, going into one of the stables, the noble little fellow gave me a thorough lesson in the alphabet. I learned it nearly all at that time, with what study I could give it by stealth during the day and night. And then again I felt lifted up and happy.             I was permitted to enjoy these advantages, however, but a short time. A black boy, belonging to Hiram's father, one day discovered our meeting and what we were doing. He told his master of it, and Hiram was at once forbidden this employment.           I had then got along so that I was reading and spelling in words of two syllables.             After I was deprived of my kind little teacher, I plodded on the best way I could by myself, and in this way I got into words of five syllables. I got some little time to study by daylight in the morning, before any of my master's family had risen. I got a moment's opportunity also at noon, and sometimes at night. During the day I was in the back store a good deal, and whenever I thought I could have a few minutes to myself, I would take my book and try to learn a little in reading and spelling. If I heard James, or master Jones, or any customer coming in, I would drop my book among the barrels, and pretended to be very busy  shovelling  the salt or doing some other work. Several times I came very near being detected. My master suspected something, because I was so still in the back room, and a number of times he came very slyly to see what I was about. But at such times I was always so fortunate as to hear his tread or to see his shadow on the wall in time to hide away my book.             When I had got along to words of five syllables, I went to see a free colored friend, Ned Cowen, whom I knew I could trust, and told him that I was trying to learn to read, and asked him to help me a little. He told me I had got along far enough to get another book, in which I could learn to write the letters, as well as to read. He told me where and how to procure this book. I followed his directions, and obtained another spelling book at Worcester's store in Wilmington. Jacob showed me a little about writing. He set me a copy, first of straight marks. I now got me a box, which I could hide under my bed, some ink, pens, and a bit of candle. So, when I went to bed, I pulled my box out from under my cot, turned it up on end, and began my first attempt at writing. I worked away till my candle was burned out, and then lay down to sleep. Jacob next set me a copy, which he called pot-hooks; then, the letters of the alphabet. These letters were also in my new spelling-book, and according to Jacob's directions, I set them before me for a copy, and wrote on these exercises till I could form all the letters and call them by name. One evening, I wrote out my name in large letters, -- THOMAS JONES. This I carried to Jacob, in a great excitement of happiness, and he warmly commended me for my perseverance and  dilligence .             About this time, I was at the store early one morning, and thinking I was safe from all danger for a few minutes, had seated myself in the back store, on one of the barrels, to study in my precious spelling-book.  While I was absorbed in this happy           enterprise, my master came in, much earlier than usual, and I did not hear him. He came directly into the back store. I saw his shadow on the wall, just in time to throw my book over in among the barrels, before he could see what it was, although he saw that I had thrown something quickly away. His suspicion was aroused. He said that I had been stealing something out of the store, and he fiercely ordered me to get what I threw away just as he was coming in at the door. Without a moment's hesitation, I determined to save my precious book and my future opportunities to learn out of it. I knew if my book was discovered, that all was lost, and I felt prepared for any hazard or suffering rather than give up my book and my hopes of improvement. So I replied at once to his question, that I had not thrown anything away; that I had not stolen anything from the store; that I did not have anything in my hands which I could throw away when he came in. My master declared, in high passion, that I was lying, and ordered me to begin and roll away the barrels. This I did; but managed to keep the book slipping along so that he could not see it, as he stood in the door-way. He charged me again with stealing and throwing something away, and I again denied the charge. In a great rage, he then got down his long, heavy cow-hide, and ordered me to strip off my jacket and shirt, saying, with an oath,  I will make you tell me what it was you had when I came in.  I stripped myself, and came forward, according to his directions, the same time denying his charge with great earnestness of tone, and look, and manner. He cut me on my naked back, perhaps thirty times, with great severity, making the blood flow freely. He then stopped, and asked me what I had thrown away as he came in. I answered again that I had thrown nothing away. He swore terribly; said he was certain I was lying,  and declared that he would kill me, if I did not tell him the truth. He whipped me the second time with greater severity, and at greater length than before. He then repeated his question,  and I answered again as before. I was determined to die, if I could possibly bear the pain, rather than give up my dear book. He whipped me the third time, with the same result as before, and then, seizing hold of my shoulders, turned me round, as though he would inflict on my quivering flesh still another scourging; but he saw the deep gashes he had already made, and the blood already flowing under his cruel infliction; and his stern purpose failed him. He said,   Why, Tom, I  din't  think I had cut you so bad,  and, saying that, he stopped, and told me to put on my shirt again. I did as he bade me, although my coarse shirt touching my raw back put me to a cruel pain. He           then went out, and I got my book and hid it safely away before he came in again. When I went to the house, my wounds had dried and I was in an agony of pain. My mistress told the servant girl, Rachel, to help me off with my shirt, and to wash my wounds for me, and to put on to them some sweet oil. The shirt was dried to my back, so that it could not be got off without tearing off some of the skin with it. The pain, upon doing this, was greater even than I had endured from my cruel whipping. After Rachel had got my shirt off, my mistress asked me what I had done for which my master had whipped me so severely. I told her he had accused me of stealing when I had not, and then had whipped me to make me own it.             While Rachel was putting on the sweet oil, my master came in, and I could hear mistress scolding him for giving me such an inhuman beating, when I had done nothing. He said in reply, that Tom was an obstinate liar, and that was the reason why he had whipped me.             But I got well of my mangled back, and my book was as still left. This was my best, my constant friend. With great eagerness,  I snatched every moment I could get, morning, noon, and night, for study. I had begun to read; and, Oh, how I loved to study, and to dwell on the thoughts which I gained from my reading. About this time, I read a piece in my book about God. It said that  God, who sees and knows all our thoughts, loves the good and makes them happy; while he is angry with the bad, and will punish them for all their sins.  This made me feel very  unhapdy , because I was sure that I was not good in the sight of God. I thought about this, and couldn't get it out of my mind a single hour. So I went to James Galley, a colored man, who exhorted the slaves sometimes on Sunday, and told him my trouble, asking,  what shall I do?  He told me about Jesus, and told me I must pray the Lord to forgive me and help me to be good and happy. So I went home, and went down cellar and prayed, but I found no relief, no comfort for my unhappy mind. I felt so bad, that I could not even study my book. My master saw that I looked very unhappy, and he asked me what ailed me. I did not dare now to tell a lie, for I wanted to be good, that I might be happy. So I told master  just how it was with me; and then he swore terribly at me, and said he would whip me if I did not give over praying. He said there was no heaven and no hell, and that Christians were all hypocrites, and that there was nothing, after this life, and that he would not permit me to go moping round, praying and going to the meetings. I told him I could not help praying; and then he cursed me in a great passion, and declared that he would           whip me if he knew of my going on any more in that foolish way.  The next night I was to a meeting, which was led by Jack Cammon, a free colored man, and a class leader in the Methodist Church. I was so much overcome by my feelings, that I  staid  very late. They prayed for me, but I did not yet find any relief; I was still very unhappy. The next morning, my master came in, and asked me if I went the night before to the meeting. I told him the truth. He said,   didn't I tell you I would whip you if you went nigh these meetings, and didn't I tell you to stop this foolish praying.  I told him he did, and if he would, why, he might whip me, but still I could not stop praying, because I wanted to be good, that I might be happy and go to heaven. This reply made my master very angry. With many bitter oaths, he said he had promised me a whipping, and now he should be as good as his word. And so he was. He whipped me, and then forbade, with bitter threatenings, my praying any more, and especially my going again to meeting. This was Friday morning. I continued to pray for comfort and peace. The next Sunday I went to meeting. The minister preached a sermon on being born again, from the words of Jesus  to Nicodemus. All this only deepened my trouble of mind. I returned home very unhappy. Collins, a free man of color, was at the meeting, and told my master that I was there. So, on Monday morning my master whipped me again, and once more forbade my going to meetings and praying. The next Sunday there was a class meeting, led by Binney Pennison, a colored free man. I asked my master, towards night, if I might go out. I told him I did not feel well. I wanted to go to the class meeting. Without asking me where I was going, he said I might go. I went to the class. I  staid  very late, and was so overcome by my feelings, that I could not go home that night. So they carried me to Joseph Jones's cabin, a slave of Mr. Jones. Joseph talked and, prayed with me nearly all night. In the morning I went home as soon as it was light, and, for fear of master, I asked Nancy, one of the slaves, to go up into mistress's  room and get the store key for me, that I might go and open the store. My master told her to go back and tell me to come up. I obeyed with many fears. My master asked me where I had been the night before. I told him the whole truth. He cursed me again, and said he should whip me for my obstinate disobedience; and he declared that he would kill me if I did not promise to obey him. He refused to listen to my mistress who was a professor, and who tried to intercede for me. And, just as soon as he had finished threatening me with what he would do, he ordered me to take the key and go and open           the store. When he came into the store that morning, two of his neighbors, Julius Dumbiven, and MacCauslin, came in too. He called me up, and asked me again where I  staid  last night. I told him with his boy, Joseph. He said he knew that was a lie; and he immediately sent off for Joseph to confirm his suspicions. He ordered me to strip off my clothes, and, as I did so, he took down the cow hide heavy and stiff with blood which he had before drawn from my body with that cruel weapon, and which was congealed upon it. Dumbiven professed to be a Christian, and he now came forward and earnestly interceded for me, but to no purpose, and then he left. McCauslin asked my master, if he did not know, that a slave was worth more money after he became pious than he was before. And why then, he said, should you forbid Tom going to meetings and praying? He replied, that religion was all a damned mockery, and he was not going to have any of his slaves praying and whining round about their souls. McCauslin then left. Joseph came and told the same story about the night before that I had done, and then began to beg master not to whip me. He cursed him and drove him off. He then whipped me with great severity, inflicting terrible pain at every blow upon my quivering body which was still very tender from recent lacerations. My suffering was so great, that it seemed to me that I should die. He paused at length, and asked me would I mind him and stop praying. I told him I could not promise him not to pray any more, for I felt that I must and should pray as long as I lived.  Well, then, Tom,  he said,  I swear that I will whip you to death.  I told him I could not help myself, if he was determined to kill me, but that I must pray while I lived. He then began to whip me the second time, but soon stopped, threw down the bloody cow-hide, and told me to go wash myself in the river, just back of the store, and then dress myself, and if I was determined to be a fool, why I must be one. My mistress now interceded earnestly for me with my cruel master. The next Sabbath was love feast, and I felt very anxious to join in that feast. This I could not do without a paper from my master, and so I asked mistress to help me. She advised me to be patient, and said she would help me all she could. Master refused to give any paper, and so I could not join the loving feast the next day.             On the next Friday evening, I went to the prayer meeting. Jack Cammon was there, and opened the meeting with prayer. Then Binney Pennison gave out the sweet hymn, which begins in these words:      Come ye sinners poor and needy,               I felt that it all applied most sweetly to my condition, and I said in my heart, I will come now to Jesus, and trust in him. So when those who felt anxious were requested to come forward and kneel within the altar for prayer, I came and knelt down. While Jacob Cammon was praying for me, and for those who knelt by my side, my burden of sorrow, which had so long weighed me down, was removed. I felt the glory of God's love warming my heart, and making me very happy, I shouted aloud for joy, and tried to tell all my poor slave brothers and sisters, who were in the house, what a dear Saviour I had found, and how happy I felt in his precious love. Binney Pennison asked me if I could forgive my master. I told him I could, and did, and that I could pray God to forgive him, too, and make him a good man. He asked me if I could tell my master of the change in my feelings. I told him I should tell him in the morning.  And what,  he asked,  will you do if he whips you still for praying and going to meeting ?  I said I will ask Jesus to help me bear the pain, and to forgive my master for being so wicked. He then said,   Well, then, Brother Jones, I believe that you are a Christian.              A good many of us went from the meeting to a brother's cabin, where we began to express our joy in happy songs. The palace of General Dudley was only a little way off, and he soon sent over a slave with orders to stop our noise, or he would send the patrolers upon us. We then stopped our singing, and spent the remainder of the night in talking, rejoicing, and praying. It was a night of very great happiness to me. The contrast between my feelings then, and for many weeks previous, was very great. Now all was bright and joyous in my relations towards my precious Saviour. I felt certain that Jesus was my Saviour, and in this blessed assurance, a flood of glory and joy filled my happy soul. But this sweet night passed away, and, as the morning came, I felt that I must go home, and bear the slave's heavy cross. I went and told my mistress the blessed change in my feelings. She promised me what aid she could give with my master, and enjoined upon me to be patient and very faithful to his interest, and, in this way, I should at length wear out his  opposiition  to my praying and going to meeting.             I went down to the store in a very happy state of mind. I told James my feelings.  He called me a fool, and said master would be sure to whip me. I told him I hoped I should be able to bear it, and to forgive master for his cruelty to me. Master came down, talked with me a while, and told me that he should whip me because I had disobeyed him in staying out all night. He had told me he should whip me if ever I did so, and he           should make every promise good. So I began to take off my clothes. He called me a crazy fool, and told me to keep my clothes on, till he told me to take them off. He whipped me over my jacket; but I enjoyed so much peace of mind, that I scarcely felt the cow-hide. This was the last whipping that Mr. Jones inflicted upon me.             I was then nearly eighteen years old. I waited and begged for a paper to join the Church six months before I could get it. But all this time I was cheerful, as far as a slave can be, and very earnest to do all I could for my master and mistress. I was resolved to convince them that I was happier and better for being a Christian, and my master at last acknowledged that he could not find any fault with my conduct, and that it was impossible to find a more faithful slave than I was to him. And so, at last he gave a paper to Ben English, the leader of the colored members, and I joined the love feast, and was taken into the Church on trial for six months. I was put into Billy Cochran's class. At the expiration of six months, I was received into the Church in full fellowship, Quaker Davis' class. I remained there three years. My master was much kinder after this time than he had formerly been, and I was allowed some more time to myself than I had been before. I pursued my studies as far as I could, but I soon found the utter impossibility of carrying on my studies as I wished to do. I was a slave, and all avenues to real improvement I found guarded with jealous care and cruel tenacity against the despised and desolate bondman.             I still felt a longing desire to improve, to be free, but the conviction  was getting hold of my soul, that I was only struggling in vain, when seeking to elevate myself into a manly and happy position. And now my mind was fast sinking into despair. I could read and write, and often enjoyed much happiness in poring over the very few books I could obtain; and especially, at times, I found great peace in reading my old, worn Testament. But I wanted now that hope which had filled my mind with such joy when I first began to learn to read. I found much happiness in prayer. But here, also, my mind labored in sadness and darkness much of the time.             About this time, my master was taken sick. On Sunday, he was prostrated by mortal pains and on Friday the same week, he died. He left fifteen slaves. I was purchased by Owen Holmes for $435 , 00. I was then in my twenty-third year. I had just passed through the darkest season of despairing agony that I had yet known. This came upon me in consequence of the visit, which I have already described, to my dear old desolate home. About this time, too, I entered into a new and distinct           period of life, which I will unfold in another chapter. I will close this period of sorrow and, shame with a few lines of touching interest to my mind :               in  his  sight I stood,           I enter now upon a new development of wrongs and woes which I, as slave, was called to undergo. I must go back some two or three years from the time when my master died, and I was sold to Owen Holmes. The bitterness of persecution which master Jones had kept up against me so long, because I would try to serve the Lord, had passed away. I was permitted to pray and to go to our meetings without molestation. My master laid aside his terrible severity towards me. By his treatment of me, afterwards, he  seemed  to feel that he had done me wrong in scourging me as he had done, because I could not obey his wicked command, to stop praying, and to keep   a way  from the meetings. For, after the time of my joining the Church, he allowed me to go to all the meetings, and granted to me many other little favors, which I had never before received from him. About this time, I began to feel very lonely. I wanted a friend to whom I could tell my story of sorrows, of unsatisfied longing, of new and fondly cherished plans. I wanted a companion whom I could love with all my warm affections, who should love me in return with a true and fervent heart, of whom I might think when toiling for a selfish, unfeeling master; who should dwell fondly on my memory when we were separated during the severe labors of the day, and with whom I might enjoy the blessed happiness of social endearments after the work of each day was over. My heart yearned to have a home, if it was only     
      which we did our cooking. Every evening after supper had been disposed of the slaves would spend the time till bed time in singing and telling stories.             After I got through with Mr. White I went to live with Elisha Buck with whom I lived one year. Buck was a mean poor white who had a large farm, and owned some slaves, and I made the eighth hand on the farm. He did not treat us at all well, and it was not often that we had all we wanted to eat. One day while I lived on his place I went in company with another slave into the woods and caught a pig, which we knocked in the head with a large pine knot, which we called a lighted knot, but it so happened that the owner of the pig was in the woods, and hearing the pig  squeel  came to see what the matter was We did not get away before he saw us so he went directly to Buck and told him that two of his niggers had been stealing a pig. We were  immediatly  called out          of the field by Buck, and he told the owner of the pig that he could give us a whipping, but that he could not strike us on the back, so we got about thirty-nine lashes each, and then were let go.             It did not do much good to either of us for on the following Sunday I went into the woods again and got another pig which I dressed in the night.             As I did not have every  atvantage  of a first-class slaughter house I was obliged to manage as best I could. Accordingly I built a fire and gave the pig a good singeing and while he was warm from the effects of the fire. I put him into water, and then scraped him with a case-knife and finally got him clean.             When he was properly dressed I carried him on my shoulder about three miles, and turned him over to a  poor white  who took him to a neighboring town the next day, and sold him for me. I got back to quarters before the hands were           called in the morning so that no one knew where I had been.             In due time the  poor white  gave me my share of the money he got for the pig. With this money I bought some cloth, which a white woman made into a coat and a pair of pants for me.             A few days afterwards I wore my new clothes to a  big meeting,  that is a meeting in the woods something like a camp meeting. Put the fact that they were paid for with stolen goods did not trouble me at all.             The negroes at the south seemed to think that everything that they could get hold of belonged to them.             In New England this code of morals would appear rather out of place. But if you consider that a strong able bodied slave was required to work a full year for his board and clothes. And not only this, but that he was expected to cook his own food after doing his day's work, and it will be remembered that the entire cost  o            food furnished him was in most cases less than thirty dollars per year, and that the entire outfit in the shape of clothes cost less than twelve dollars per year, making a grand total of less than forty two dollars per year or three dollars and fifty cents per month. The slave could hardly be expected to feel the same regards for his master's rights as he would have done had he been a free man, properly treated and justly paid.             While I was living with this man my mother's health began to fail, and I frequently went to see her. As her friends gathered around her she would tell them that while she did not expect to live to see it she hoped that the time would soon come when all the slaves would be free.             The war of the rebellion had at this time been in progress some months, and although our masters tried to keep all matters relating to the war from their slaves, the slaves managed to get hold     
        AUNT BETTY'S STORY.       CHAPTER I.     CHILDHOOD  -  FIRST LESSONS IN MORALITY  -  FIRST LESSON IN THE ART OF ENTERTAINING.           I HAVE but little recollection of my very early life. My mother and her five children were owned by one James Fletcher, Pass Run, town of Luray,     - that the moon would be turned into blood, the stars would fall out of the sky, and everything would melt away with a great heat, and that everybody,  every little child  that had told a lie, would be cast into a lake of fire and brimstone, and would burn there for ever and ever, and, what was more, though they should burn for ever and ever, they would never be burned up.           I was dreadfully frightened; and, as soon as I could get away, I ran to my mammy, and, repeating what mistress had said, begged to know if it could be true. To my great sorrow, she confirmed it all, but added what Miss Nasenath had failed to do; namely, that those who told the truth and were good would always have everything they should want. It seemed to me then there was nothing so good as molasses and sugar; and I eagerly asked,  Shall I have all the molasses and sugar I want, if I tell the truth?   Yes,  she replied,   if you are good;  but remember, if you tell lies, you will be burned in the lake that burns for ever and ever.            This made a very strong impression upon me. I can never forget my mammy's manner at the time. I believed every word she said, and from that day to this I have never doubted its truth.           Though my conception of what constituted the truth was very dim, my fear of what should befall me, if I were to tell a lie, was very great. Still, I was only a young child, and could not, long at a time, be very unhappy.           My old master, who at times was inclined to be jolly, had a way of entertaining his friends by my singing and dancing. Supper over, he would call me into his room, and, giving me to understand what he wanted of me, I would, with all manner of grotesque grimaces, gestures, and positions, dance and sing:  -      
     and one looked like the Son of God. O, how Aunt Jane used to love to read about the Hebrew children!              I finally got religion, and it was Aunt Jane's praying and singing them old Virginia hymns that helped me so much. Aunt Jane's marster would let her come to see me sometimes, but not often. Sometimes she would slip away from her place at night and come to see me anyhow. She would hold prayer-meeting in my house whenever she would come to see me.               Would your marster allow you to hold prayer-meeting on his place?               No, my child; if old marster heard us singing and praying he would come out and make us stop. One time, I remember, we all were having a prayer-meeting in my cabin, and marster came up to the door and hollered out,  'You, Charlotte,  what's all that fuss in there?' We all had to hush up for that night. I was so afraid old marster would see Aunt Jane. I knew Aunt Jane would have to suffer if her white people knew she was off at night. Marster used to say God was tired of us all hollering to him at night.                       Did any of the black people on his place believe in the teachings of their master?               No, my child; none of us listened to him about singing and praying. I tell you we used to have some good times together praying and singing. He did not want us to pray, but we would have our little prayer-meeting anyhow. Sometimes when we met to hold our meetings we would put a big wash-tub full of water in the middle of the floor to catch the sound of our voices when we sung. When we all sung we would march around and shake each other's hands, and we would sing easy and low, so marster could not hear us. O, how happy I used to be in those meetings, although I was a slave! I thank the Lord Aunt Jane Lee lived by me. She helped me to make my peace with the Lord. O, the day I was converted! It seemed to me it was a paradise here below! It looked like I wanted nothing any more. Jesus was so sweet to my soul! Aunt Jane used to sing, 'Jesus! the name that charms our fears.' That hymn just suited my case. Sometimes I felt like preaching myself. It seemed I wanted to ask every body if they loved Jesus when I first got converted. I wanted to ask          old marster, but he was Creole, and did not understand what I said much. Aunt Jane was the cause of so many on our plantation getting religion. We did not have any church to go to, but she would talk to us about old Virginia, how people done there. She said them beads and crosses we saw every body have was nothing. She said people must give their hearts to God, to love him and keep his commandments; and we believed what she said. I never wanted them beads I saw others have, for I just thought we would pray without any thing, and that God only wanted the heart.        
      CHAPTER XI.             I attend a prayer meeting.--Punishment therefor threatened.--I attempt to escape  alone.--My return to take my family.--Our sufferings.--Dreadful attack of wolves.--Our recapture.              SOME months after Malinda had recovered from her sickness, I got permission from the Deacon, on one Sabbath day, to  attend a prayer meeting, on a neighboring plantation, with a few old superanuated slaves, although this was contrary to  the custom of the country--for slaves were not allowed to assemble for religious worship. Being more numerous than  the whites there was fear of rebellion, and the overpowering of their oppressors in order to obtain freedom.            But this gentleman on whose plantation I attended the meeting was not a Deacon nor a professor of religion. He was not  afraid of a few old Christian slaves rising up to kill their master because he allowed them to worship God on the Sabbath  day.            We had a very good meeting, although our exercises were not conducted in accordance with an enlightened Christianity;  for we had no Bible--no intelligent leader--but a conscience, prompted by our own reason, constrained us to  worship God the Creator of all things.            When I returned home from meeting I told the          other slaves what a good time we had at our meeting, and requested them to go with me to meeting thereon the next Sabbath.  As no slave was allowed to go from the plantation on a visit without a written pass from his master, on the next Sabbath  several of us went to the Deacon, to get permission to attend that prayer meeting ; but he refused to let any go. I  thought I would slip off and attend the meeting and get back before he would miss me, and would not know that I had been  to the meeting.            When I returned home from the meeting as I approached the house I saw Malinda, standing out at the fence looking in  the  direction in which I was expected to return. She hailed my approach, not with joy, but with grief. She was weeping under great distress of mind, but it was hard for me to extort from her the reason why she wept. She finally  in formed me that her master had found out that I had violated his law, and I should suffer the penalty, which was five hundred lashes, on my naked back.            I asked her how he knew that I had gone?            She said I had not long been gone before he called for me and I was not to be found. He then sent the overseer on  horseback to the place where we were to meet to see if I was there. But when the overseer got to the place, the meeting  was over and I had gone back home, but had gone a nearer route through the woods and the overseer happened not to meet me.  He heard that I had been there and hurried back home before me and told the Deacon, who ordered him to take me on the next morning, strip off my clothes, drive down four stakes in the          ground and fasten my limbs to them; then strike me five hundred lashes for going to the prayer meeting. This was what  distressed my poor companion. She thought it was more than I could bear, and that it would be the death of me. I concluded  then to run away--but she thought they would catch me with the blood hounds by their taking my track. But to avoid  them I thought I would ride off on one of the Deacon's mules. She thought if I did, they would sell me.             No matter, I will try it,  said I,  let the consequences be what they may. The matter can be no  worse than it now is.  So I tackled up the Deacon's best mule with his saddle,  c., and started that night and  went off eight or ten miles from home. But I found the mule to be rather troublesome, and was like to betray me by braying, especially when he would see cattle, horses, or any thing of the kind in the woods.            The second night from home I camped in a cane break down in the Red river swamp not a great way off from the road, perhaps not twenty rods, exposed to wild ferocious beasts which were numerous in that section of country. On that night about the middle of the night the mule heard the sound of horses feet on the road, and he commenced stamping and trying to break away. As the horses seemed to come nearer, the mule commenced trying to bray, and it was all that I could do to prevent him from making a loud bray there in the woods, which would have betrayed me.            I supposed that it was the overseer out with the     
               Whilst I thus struggled, there seemed a light from heaven to fall upon me, which banished all my desponding fears, and I was enabled to form a new resolution to go on to prison and to death, if it might be my portion: and the Lord showed me that it was His will I should be resigned to die any death that might be my lot, in carrying his message, and be entirely crucified to the world, and sacrifice  all  to His glory that was then in my possession, which His witnesses, the holy Apostles, had done before me. It was then revealed to me that the Lord had given me the evidence of a clean heart, in which I could rejoice day and night, and I walked and talked with God, and my soul was illuminated with heavenly light, and I knew nothing but Jesus Christ, and him crucified.             One day, after those things, while I was at my work, the Spirit directed me to go to a poor widow, and ask her if I might have a meeting at her house,  which was situated in one of the lowest and worst streets in Baltimore. With great joy she gave  notice, and at the time appointed I appeared there among a few coloured sisters. When they had all prayed, they called upon me to close the meeting, and I felt an impression that I must say a few words; and while I was speaking, the house seemed filled with light; and when I was about to close the meeting,  and was kneeling, a man came in and stood till           I arose. It proved to be a watchman. The sisters became so frightened, they all went away except the one who lived in the house, and an old woman; they both appeared to be much frightened, fearing they should receive some personal injury, or be put out of the house. A feeling of weakness came over me for a short time, but I soon grew warm and courageous in the Spirit. The man then said to me,  I was sent here to break up your meeting. Complaint has been made to me that the people round here cannot sleep for the racket.  I replied,  a good racket is better than a bad racket. How do they rest when the ungodly are dancing and fiddling till midnight? Why are not they molested by the watchmen? and why should we be for praising God, our Maker? Are we worthy of greater punishment for praying to Him? and are we to be prohibited from doing so, that sinners may remain slumbering in their sins?  While speaking these few words I grew warm with  heavenly  zeal, and laid my hand upon him and addressed him with gospel truth,  how do sinners sleep in hell, after slumbering in their sins here, and crying, 'let me rest, let me rest,' while sporting on the very brink of hell? Is the cause of God to be destroyed for this purpose?   Speaking several words more to this amount, he turned pale and trembled, and begged my pardon, acknowledging that it was not his wish to interrupt us, and that           he would never disturb a religious assembly again. He then took leave of me in a comely manner and wished us success. After he was gone, I turned to the old sisters who by this time were quite cheered up. You see, said I, if the sisters had not fled, what a victory we might have had on the Lord's side; for the man seemed ready to give up under conviction. If it had not been for their cowardice, we might have all bowed in prayer, and a shout of victory had been heard amongst us.             Our meeting gave great offence, and we were forbid holding any more assemblies. Even the elders of our meeting joined with the wicked people, and said such meetings must be stopped, and that woman quieted. But I was not afraid of any of them, and continued to go, and burnt with a zeal not my own. The old sisters were zealous sometimes, and at other times would sink under the cross. Thus they grow cold, at which I was much grieved. I proposed to them to ask the elders to send a brother, which was concluded upon.             We went on for several years, and the Lord was with us with great power it proved, to the conversion of many souls, and we continued to grow stronger.             I felt at times that I must exercise in the ministry, but when I rose upon my feet I felt  ashmed , and so I went under a cloud for some time, and endeavoured     
   I know nothing of the others, nor am I likely ever to hear of them again.          The treatment of slaves is mildest near the borders, where the free and slave states join: it becomes more severe, the further we go from the free states. It is more severe in the west and south than where I lived. The sale of slaves most frequently takes place from the milder to the severer parts: in that directtion,  there is great traffic in slaves, which is carried on by the speculators. On the frontier between the slave and free states there is a guard; no coloured person can go over a ferry without a pass. By these regulations, and the great numbers of patrols, escape is made very difficult.          Formerly slaves were allowed to have religious  meetings of their own; but after the insurrection which I spoke of before, they were forbidden to meet even for worship. Often they are flogged, if they are found singing or praying at home. They may go to the places of worship used by the whites; but they like their own meetings better. My wife's brother Isaac        was a coloured preacher. A number of slaves went privately into the wood to hold meetings; when they were found out, they were flogged, and each was forced to tell who else was there. Three were shot, two of whom were killed, and the other was badly wounded. For preaching to them, Isaac was flogged, and his back pickled; when he was nearly well, he was flogged and pickled again, and so on for some months; then his back was suffered to get well, and he was sold. A little while before this, his wife was sold away with an infant at her breast; and of his six children,  four had been sold away by one at a time. On the way with his buyers he dropped down dead; his heart was broken.          Having thus narrated what has happened to myself, my relatives, and near friends, I will add a few matters about slaves and coloured persons in general.          Slaves are under fear in every word they speak. If in their master's kitchen they let slip an expression of discontent, or a wish for freedom, it is often reported to the master or mistress by the children of the family, who may     
    Christian religion, and endeavored to obey the precepts  according to their light.     RELIGIOUS MEETINGS OF THE SLAVES.             Saturday evening on the farm was always hailed  with delight. The air was filled with happy shouts  from men and boys, so glad were they that Sunday,  their only day of rest, was near. In the cabins the  women were washing and fixing garments for Sunday,  that they might honor the Lord in cleanliness and  decency. It was astonishing how they utilized what  they had, and with what skill and industry they performed  these self-imposed tasks. Where the family  was large it was often after midnight before this  work was done. While this preparation for the  Sabbath was in progress in most of the cabins, the  old men would gather in one for a prayer-meeting.  As they began to sing some familiar hymn, the air  would ring with their voices, and it was not long  before the cabin was filled with both old and young,  who came in their simple yet sincere way to give  praise to God. It was common to have one or two  exhorters on the plantation who claimed to be called  to do service for God, by teaching their fellow men  the principles of religion. God certainly must have         revealed himself to these poor souls, for they were  very ignorant  -  they did not know a letter of the Bible.  But when they opened their mouths they were filled,  and the plan of Salvation was explained in a way  that all could receive it. It was always a mystery to  the white brethren how the slaves could line out  hymns, preach Christ and redemption, yet have no  knowledge even of how the name of Christ was  spelled. They were illiterate to the last degree, so  there is but one theory, they were inspired. God  revealed unto them just what they should teach their  flock, the same as he did to Moses. I remember very  well that there was always a solemnity about the  services  -  a certain harmony, which had a peculiar  effect  -  a certain pathetic tone which quickened the  emotions as they sang those old plantation hymns.  It mattered not what their troubles had been during  the week  -  how much they had been lashed, the  prayer-meeting on Saturday evening never failed to be held. Their faith was tried and true. On Sunday  afternoons, they would all congregate again to praise  God, and the congregation was enthusiastic. It was  pathetic to hear them pray, from the depths of their  hearts, for them who  despitefully used them and          persecuted them.  This injunction of our Saviour  was strictly adhered to. The words that came from  the minister were always of a consolatory kind. He  knew the crosses of his fellow slaves and their hardships,  for he had shared them himself. I was always touched in hearing him give out the hymns. I can hear old Uncle Ben now, as he solemnly worded out the following lines:             After singing he would always speak to them of  the necessity for patience in bearing the crosses, urging  them to endure  as good soldiers.  Many tears  were shed, and many glad shouts of praise would  burst forth during the sermon. A hymn usually followed  the sermon, then all retired. Their faces  seemed to shine with a happy light  -  their very  countenance showed that their souls had been refreshed  and that it had been  good for them to be there.   These meetings were the joy and comfort of the slaves,  and even those who did not profess Christianity were  calm and thoughtful while in attendance.      
             The next day, the town patrols were commissioned to search colored people that lived out of the city; and the most shocking outrages were committed with perfect impunity. Every day for a fortnight, if I looked out, I saw horsemen with some poor panting negro tied to their saddles, and compelled by the lash to keep up with their speed, till they arrived at the jail yard. Those who had been whipped too unmercifully to walk were washed with brine, tossed into a cart, and carried to jail. One black man, who had not fortitude to endure scourging, promised to give information about the conspiracy. But it turned out that he knew nothing at all. He had not even heard the name of Nat Turner. The poor fellow had, however, made up a story, which augmented his own sufferings and those of the colored people.           The day patrol continued for some weeks, and at sundown a night guard was substituted. Nothing at all was proved against the colored people, bond or free. The wrath of the slaveholders was somewhat appeased by the capture of Nat Turner. The imprisoned were released. The slaves were sent to their masters, and the free were permitted to return to their ravaged homes. Visiting was strictly forbidden on the plantations. The slaves begged the privilege of again meeting at their little church in the woods, with their burying ground around it. It was built by the colored people, and they had no higher happiness than to meet there and sing hymns together, and pour out their hearts in spontaneous prayer. Their request was denied, and the church was demolished. They were permitted to attend the white churches, a certain portion      
     But now I thought that if my master would only come to Jesus he could be saved. I began to pray for the white people, and to tell all around what a dear Salvation I had found.      SPIRITUAL FREEDOM.              Free indeed,  John viii., 36. I had now a free soul. But my poor mother, who had taught me the Lord's Prayer and for years been so anxious that I should  seek religion,  had never herself understood the finished work of Christ. She now, however, accepted Him as her own Saviour, and gave herself to the Lord in glad and full surrender. I was anxious, after my conversion, to unite with the Baptist Church. In Richmond there were Churches of coloured people, but they had white Pastors, who never failed to keep us informed about Abraham's servants, and as to the injunction to Hagar. I could not join any Church unless I had a  pass  from my master. I went to him and asked permission to be baptised. He at once said:  No, you shall not unite with the Baptist Church.  Mr. Brown, my spiritual adviser, told me to go to the Lord, and say,  Lord, if Thou hast ever done anything for my never-dying soul, please manifest Thyself to me in moving the master to give me a pass to be baptised.  I think it was nearly three months before I again ventured to ask him. But when I summoned up enough courage to ask him the second time, he at once gave permission. This was a manifest answer to prayer. When the appointed Sabbath for baptism arrived, my mother and I  went down into the water  hand-in-hand, and were baptised, rejoicing in the privilege of following our Divine Master, and when we  came up out of the water  we  went on our way rejoicing.              Soon after my conversion I felt a deep desire to preach the Gospel. But two difficulties presented themselves: first, I was a slave, for though I had a free soul, yet my body was in slavery; then, second, I could not read the          Bible with much understanding, and there was no way for me to succeed but the old way, that, was, by  taking advantage of every opportunity to learn all I could.  Just about this time a young student (white) came from College on the Sabbaths to preach to the coloured people. He read the fifth chapter of Matthew. I was much struck with his explanation, and I became anxious to know how to read this chapter. Now there was a box of old books stored away in a lumber room, and amongst these books was a large old Bible. I took this Bible to my room, and day after day, when I had finished my work in the house, and had a little time to spare, I would go to my room, lock myself in, and try to read the Bible, commencing at Genesis and calling over the letters of each word I could not understand as follows:-- In the b-e-g-i-n-n-i-n-g God c-r-e-a-t-e-d the heaven and the earth ; and thus I struggled on from day to day. The young master had been requested by his mother to read a chapter in the New Testament every night. Often when with him in his own room at night I would get him to read the fifth chapter of Matthew for me. To the reading of this I would listen attentively. Thus I got to know the words  multitudes,   mountain,   disciples,   blessed,  and in time I had learned to repeat many verses of the chapter from memory. I then began to look about in the Bible, and found in many places the same words in the first and second syllables that I knew. In this way I got to understand a little about the Bible, and at the same time I was learning to spell. After my conversion I would often  Steal away to Jesus  with other slaves, to some quiet place for prayer, over the stable, or in the kitchen when the master and mistress were away, though we knew that if we were discovered we should be locked up for the night, and that the next morning we should receive from five to nine or even thirty lashes for unlawfully assembling together. Over five slaves in such a gathering, though they had passes,          constituted an unlawful assembly. At night no slave was allowed to be out without a pass from his master. We used to have such a good time at these meetings. No wonder the Jubilee Singers sang with such deep feeling when those of them who were once slaves remembered the meetings of this kind at which they sang and prayed almost in a whisper for fear of being heard. How appropriate to sing softly and quietly:--                   Dear Reader, have you stolen away to Jesus? Has He liberated you from spiritual bondage? His promise and encouragement are found in the words,  Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. --Rom. x. 13. Have you ever called in faith? See verse 10. If you have not, then God help you, as you look upon these words, to say, 'I will, God helping me.  Let every worldly engagement wait, and every secret plan go, and take God at His word. Doubt not our blessed Lord for a moment when He says,  Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest. --Matthew xi. 28.  Him that cometh to Me I will in no wise cast out. --John vi. 37. Stop and think of what the Lord has done for you.  Steal away to Jesus  now.  Steal away to Jesus  from your surroundings and your friends and your very self. He has proved His love to you by giving Himself a ransom for you--I Tim. ii. 6; Gal. ii. 20.  He came to seek the lost. -- Luke xix. 10.  He bore your sins in His own body on the tree. -- I Peter ii. 24.             After Jesus found me and gave me peace in my soul, I often thought of Africa, the land of my fathers, and a deep desire possessed me to go and tell my own people     
      on Tuesday morning--this was Sunday night. His house was five  miles off.             Readers, just notice what I suffered as a man, and yet these trials were good for me. Col. Jones made me suffer, in his life-time, what few man have suffered. On one occasion, I submitted to let him tie and whip me. I asked him if he didn't think be he had whipped me enough.              When I am done with you it will be night,  he replied.             I did not know my strength; I flung my foot against the tree and broke loose and got away from him and the other white man, untied the knot with my teeth. I was tempted to kill him.             This was two years before I parted with him for good. There was a day when he would take no money for me. The first time he ever talked of selling me was when I asked him to let me have a wife on Dr. Roger's plantation. He never let me see any peace after the first four years.              Bretheren,  what a blessing it is to dwell together in the spirit. Beware how you entertain a stranger, for you may entertain an angel. Have you forgotten the life we lived when we were slaves? Our sufferings were great, and in some places we were not allowed to worship God at all. We had to have secret prayer meetings on Saturday nights, and some would have to watch for the patrolmen and hard task-masters, to keep from being surprised, while the others prayed and sung. When the enemy was seen the watch would give the alarm; we would then close the meeting and make our escape, in order to keep our backs from being slashed and salted down.             In Marsh county, N. C., we had a noble speaker by the name of Minger Crudemp; he was the slave of a popular Baptist Minister, who, although he was a preacher, did not allow his slaves to worship the God he praised. This Minger Crudemp would hold prayer-meetings every Saturday night that he had a chance in spite of the penalty he would have to pay if he was caught; they would run him Saturday and Sunday.  Bretheren , see how hard it was for us so serve God in the days of slavery. In some places they were allowed to praise God, but they had to have a white man to watch them. (When I was a small boy Bethey Thompson, a religious woman, was whipped by her mistress because she would pray and shout through the day.) Oh, how hard were the lives we led in those days. It was a common thing for slave men and women to run away into the woods to keep their masters from whipping them. To day,  bretheren , we ought to love one another and be the best friends and citizens in America. Just look at the mercy of God in the midst of all the Presidents during slavery; yet we were held in bondage. God reared up Abraham Lincoln--one whom the people had not looked for--who used more power than any of the men in America. He caused the  shackels  to be thrown off the bondmen.             There are few of you who have ever thought what it cost to set you free--hundreds and thousands of lives were lost; even our greatest man, Abraham Lincoln, fell. No other man did the will of God as he did; it seemed as if he was intended to liberate us. He arose     
           While Rachel was putting on the sweet oil my master  came in, and I could hear mistress scolding him for  giving me such an inhuman beating, when I had done  nothing. He said in reply, that Tom was an obstinate  liar, and that was the reason why he had whipped me.          But I got well of my mangled back, and my book  was still left. This was my best, my constant friend.  With great eagerness, I snatched every moment I  could get, morning, noon and night, for study. I had  begun to read; and, oh, how I loved to study, and to  dwell on the thoughts which I gained from reading.  About this time, I read a piece in my book about God.  It said that  God, who sees and knows all our thoughts,  loves the good and makes them happy; while he is  angry with the bad, and will punish them for all their  sins.  This made me feel very unhappy, because I was  sure I was not good in the sight of God. I thought  about this, and could'nt get it out of my mind a single  hour. So I went to James Galley, a colored man, who  exhorted the slaves sometimes on Sunday, and told him  my trouble, asking,  what shall I do?  He told me  about Jesus, and told me I must pray the Lord to forgive  me and help me to be good and happy. So I  went home, and went down cellar and prayed, but I  found no relief, no comfort for my unhappy mind. I  felt so bad that I could not study my book. My master  saw that I looked very unhappy, and he asked me  what ailed me. I did not dare  now  to tell a lie, for I  wanted to be good, that I might be happy. So I told  my master just how it was with me; and then he swore  terribly at me, and said he would whip me if I did not  give over praying. He said there was no heaven and  no hell, and that Christians were all hypocrites, and  that there was nothing after this life, and that he would  not permit me to go moping round, praying and going  to the meetings. I told him I could not help praying,  and then he cursed me in a great passion, and declared  he would whip me if he knew of my going on any more  in that foolish way. The next night I was to a meeting,           which was led by Jack Cammon,a free colored  man, and a class leader in the Methodist Church. I  was so much overcome by my feelings, that I staid very  late. They prayed for me, but I did not yet find any  relief; I was still very unhappy. The next morning,  my master came in, and asked me if I went the night  before to the meeting. I told him the truth. He  said, didn't I tell you I would whip you if you went  nigh these meetings, and did n't I tell you to stop this  foolish praying?  I told him he did, and if he would,  why, he might whip me, but still I could not stop praying,  because I wanted to be good, that I might be happy  and go to heaven. This reply made my master  very angry. With many bitter oaths, he said he had  promised me a whipping, and now he should be as good  as his word. And so he was. He whipped me, and  then forbade, with bitter threatenings, my praying any  more, and especially my going again to meeting. This  was Friday morning. I continued to pray for comfort  and peace. The next Sunday I went to meeting. The  minister preached a sermon on being born again, from  the words of Jesus to Nicodemus. All this alone  deepened my trouble of mind. I returned home very  unhappy. Collins, a free man of color, was at the  meeting, and told my master that I was there. So, on  Monday morning my master whipped me again, and  once more forbade my going to meetings and praying.  The next Sunday there was a class meeting, led by  Binney Pennison, a colored free man. I asked my  master, towards night, if I might go out. I told him I  did not feel well. I wanted to go to the class meeting.  Without asking me  where  I was going, he said I might  go. I went to the class. I staid very late, and I was  so overcome by my feelings, that I could not go home  that night. So they carried me to Joseph Jones' cabin,  a slave of Mr. Jones. Joseph talked and prayed with  me nearly all night. In the morning I went home as  soon as it was light, and, for fear of master, I asked  Nancy, one of the slaves, to go into mistress's room       and get the store key for me, that I might go and open  the store. My master told her to go back and tell me  to come up. I obeyed with many fears. My master  asked me where I had been the night before. I told  him the whole truth. He cursed me again, and said he  should whip me for my obstinate disobedience; and he  declared he would kill me if I did not promise to obey  him. He refused to listen to my mistress, who was a  professor, and who tried to intercede for me. And,  just as soon as he had finished threatening me with  what he would do, he ordered me to take the key and  go and open the store. When he came into the store  that morning, two of his neighbors, Julius Dumbiven, and McCauslin, came in too. He called me up and asked  me again where I staid last night. I told him with  his boy, Joseph. He said he knew that was a lie; and  he immediately sent off for Joseph to confirm his suspicions.  He ordered me to strip off my clothes, and,  as I did so, he took down the cow-hide, heavy and stiff  with blood which he had before drawn from my body  with that cruel weapon, and which was congealed upon  it. Dumbiven professed to be a Christian, and he now  came forward, and earnestly interceded for me, but to  no purpose, and then he left. McCauslin asked my  master, if he did not know that a slave was worth  more money after he became pious than he was before.  And why then, he said, should you forbid Tom going  to meetings and praying? He replied, that religion  was all a damned mockery, and he was not going to  have any of his slaves praying and whining round  about their souls. McCauslin then left. Joseph came  and told the same story about the night before that I  had done; and then he began to beg master not to  whip me. He cursed him and drove him off. He then  whipped me with great severity, inflicting terrible pain  at every blow upon my quivering body, which was still  very tender from recent lacerations. My suffering was  so great, that it seemed to me I should die. He paused  at length, and asked me would I mind him and stop       praying. I told him I could not promise him not to  pray any more, for I felt that I must and should pray  as long as I lived.  Well, then, Tom,  he said,  I  swear that I will whip you to death.  I told him I  could not help myself, if he was determined to kill me,  but that  I must pray while I lived.  He then began to  whip me the second time, but soon stopped, threw down  the bloody cowhide, and told me to go wash myself in  the river, just back of the store, and then dress myself,  and if I was determined to be a fool, why, I must be  one. My mistress now interceded earnestly for me  with my cruel master. The next Sabbath was love  feast, and I felt very anxious to join in that feast. This  I could not do without a paper from my master, and so  I asked mistress to help me. She advised me to be  patient, and said she would help me all she could.  Master refused to give any paper, and so I could not  join in the love feast the next day.          On the next Friday evening, I went to the prayer  meeting. Jack Cammon was there, and opened the  meeting with prayer. Then Binney Pennison gave  out the sweet hymn, which begins in these words:    Come ye sinners, poor and needy,  Weak and wounded, sick and sore.             I felt that it all  applied most sweetly to my condition,  and I said in my heart,  I  will come  now  to Jesus, and   trust  in him. So when those who felt anxious were  requested to come forward and kneel within the altar  for prayer,  I  came and knelt down. While Jacob  Cammon was praying for me, and for those who knelt  by my side, my burden of sorrow, which had so long  weighed me down, was removed. I felt the glory of  God's love warming my heart, and making me very  happy. I shouted aloud for joy, and tried to tell all  my poor slave brothers and sisters, who were in the  house, what a dear Saviour I had found, and how happy  I felt in his precious love. Binney Pennison asked me  if I could forgive my master. I told him I could, and           did, and that I could pray God to forgive him, too, and  make him a good man. He asked me if I could tell  my master of the change in my feelings. I told him I  should  tell him in the morning.  And what,  he said    will you do if he whips you still for praying and  going to meeting?  I said I will ask Jesus to help  me to bear the pain, and to forgive my master for being  so wicked. He then said,  Well, then, Brother  Jones, I believe that you are a Christian.           A good many of us went from the meeting to a  brother's cabin, where we began to express our joy in  happy songs. The palace of General Dudley was only  a little way off, and he soon sent over a slave with  orders to stop our noise, or he would send the patrolers  upon us. We then stopped our singing and spent the  remainder of the night in talking, rejoicing and praying.  It was a night of very great happiness to me.  The contrast between my feelings then, and for many  weeks previous, was very great. Now, all was bright  and joyous in my relations towards my precious Saviour.  I felt certain that Jesus was my Saviour, and in this  blessed assurance a flood of glory and joy filled my  happy soul. But this sweet night passed away, and,  as the morning came, I felt that I must go home, and  bear the  slave's heavy  cross. I went, and told my mistress  the blessed change in my feelings. She promised  me what aid she could give me with my master, and  enjoined upon me to be patient and very faithful to his  interest, and, in this way, I should at length wear out  his opposition to my praying and going to meeting.          I went down to the store in a very happy state of  mind. I told James my feelings. He called me a  fool, and said master would be sure to whip me. I  told him I hoped I should be able to bear it, and to forgive  master for his cruelty to me. Master came down,  talked with me a while, and told me he should whip me  because I had disobeyed him in staying out all night.  He had told me he should whip me if ever I did so, and  he should make every promise good. So I began to  take off my clothes. He called me a crazy fool, and       
      whip me if he knew of my going on any more in that foolish way.  The next night I was to a meeting, which was led by Jack Cammon, a free colored man, and a class leader in the Methodist Church. I was so much overcome by my feelings, that I  staid  very late. They prayed for me, but I did not yet find any relief; I was still very unhappy. The next morning, my master came in, and asked me if I went the night before to the meeting. I told him the truth.

I told him he did, and if he would, why, he might whip me, but still I could not stop praying, because I wanted to be good, that I might be happy and go to heaven. This reply made my master very angry. With many bitter oaths, he said he had promised me a whipping, and now he should be as good as his word. And so he was. He whipped me, and then forbade, with bitter threatenings, my praying any more, and especially my going again to meeting. This was Friday morning. I continued to pray for comfort and peace.

   CHAPTER  III.    HER COMMISSION.            In those days there were no churches for the slaves on the   plantation, but they were compelled to go from one plantation   to another to hold their meetings in their log cabins. She   used to go with her aunt and others to those prayer meetings.   The mighty power of God would be in the meetings. They   would hold their meetings sometimes nearly all night. Many   would fall under the mighty power of God, and many of them  would get soundly converted.          Our subject was greatly urged to seek the Lord. She went   forward and soon found that she was a lost sinner without the   blood of Jesus to wash away all her sins.           They would  work hard all day in the corn fields and nearly  every night would go two or three miles from home to attend   meeting. Many were converted every night. She was somewhat  discouraged because she was so slow to believe. Her   cousin fell under the mighty power of God, and was happily  converted, coming through shouting and praising God, and   commenced at once to preach to the people, telling them to flee   from the wrath to come. She said to our subject to believe   and she would be converted. This encouraged her to go on.   	     She was trying to get converted shouting, like her cousin, but   the Dear Lord did not come to her in that way. She did reason  with the devil for some time, who told her that if she did   not shout she would not have religion. She had a terrible   struggle to get over that. After that terrible struggle about   getting converted shouting, her faith was greatly increased, and  while she was praying one day she was wonderfully blessed.   She told her cousin how she felt. Her cousin told her that she   had religion. She said,  Oh, no, I am just getting in a good   way.  She did not understand the scheme of the devil, so she   was defeated and had to do her work all over again . But the   Holy Spirit still strove with her. The meetings were still going  on with increased power. She attended nearly ever night.   The old people encouraged her, and then she began to take part   in speaking and praying. By so doing the same blessing came   to her again, but she was not satisfied. She went on in that   state quite a long time. Finally one night she went to bed and   fell into a dream, or trance, she did not know which. However  a man came to her while she was in that vision. She was   trying to cross a clear stream of water. The man she believed   to be a white man. He threw a narrow board in the middle of   the stream of water, and there was also a broad board in the   stream. The man told her to make her choice. She stepped   on the narrow one and went across. As soon as she was across   he showed her a beautiful place and told her it was heaven.   She saw her cousin there and she was with all the angels. They   were all just alike. She turned to come back, when she heard   a voice saying:  You have just as much religion as those who   shout. After that she woke up. She felt very strange and   told her aunt about the vision. Her aunt said that she would         get through all right. In a short time afterwards she received   the witness of the Holy Spirit that her sins were all forgiven.   She was then a happy girl. She knew that her sins were all   washed away by the blood of Jesus. She could sing this song:                                          Oh! happy day, that fixed my choice,                                       On Thee, my Savior and my God;                                         Well may this glowing heart rejoice,                                      And tell its rapture all abroad.                                         Happy day! Happy day!                                       When Jesus washed my sins away.                                       He taught me how to watch and pray,                                      And live rejoicing every day,                                       Happy day! Happy day!                                       When Jesus washed my sins away.            The meeting spread  from one plantation to another, and   many of the poor slaves' hearts were made to rejoice, for the   Lord Jesus visited them, notwithstanding they were treated   only as cattle and horses. Thanks be unto the Lord God of   Heaven, who did look down upon them in their helpless condition  in tender mercy.           The subject of this sketch was a faithful young Christian,   laboring in the prayer meetings from house to house. They did   not have churches of their own. She related that one night   their prayer meeting continued until daylight, the power of   God having fallen upon the people in such a wonderful manner   that they fell on the floor like dead men and women. Many   of them had to go one, two and three miles to their homes, and   some of them were greatly punished for being away from their   houses at that late hour of night, for most all of them were,          compelled to go to work before daylight. But in spite of all   this cruel treatment they would pray and sing so that it would   disturb their old masters so that they could not sleep and they   would whip them, but still the poor slaves would continue to   serve the Lord.          Our subject said that one of the masters in that part of   Kentucky, a cruel slave holder whose name we can not recall,   had a slave (a man) by  the name of Dick, who was a true man   of God. His master was so bitterly opposed to his serving the   Lord as not to even permit him to return thanks at the table   before taking his meals. But Dick had settled the matter, and   the more his master would punish him the more he would pray   for his master.  At length his prevailing prayer with his God   was the salvation of his master, and he was converted in a   wonderful manner at a camp meeting.  Dick was present, and   his master ran to him, threw his arms around him and took   him up and carried him around in the camp ground. After his    conversion he set Dick free, and, giving him a horse, saddle   and bridle, told  him to go and preach the gospel everywhere.   He also set free all the rest of  his slaves. Oh, it is wonderful how God can use a man. This is true        
                    Some slaves were good dancers, especially the young girls, some of whom could dance so steadily that if a glass of water were placed on their heads none of the water would be spilt. I have often seen a girl dance for ten minutes with a glass cup filled with water on her head without any of it being spilt.             If the next day was Sunday or was a holiday, the dance would  contiuue  all night. The young men would dance all night till broad daylight, and then go home with the girls in the morning.             In some other cabin, perhaps on the same plantation, while the young people were dancing, the old ones would be holding a prayer  meetin' , notice having been sent out as in the case of the dance. As none of the slaves could read, there were no books at these meetings. When the folks got together some one would begin with a prayer, or           perhaps with a hymn, in which he or she would be followed by all in the room, unless it happened that they did not know the piece, which was perhaps being made up as the singer went along.             Of course there were no musical conductors, but the slaves in part made up for this lack by keeping time with their feet and hands. These meetings would sometimes last all night, and the slaves, ignorant as they were, always enjoyed them.             The following hymn was one of the most popular, and was sure to be sung at these meetings:       Roll Jordan roll, roll Jordan roll,                           I want to be in de kingdom,                           To heah ole Jordan roll.                           You see dat falcon a-lighting,                           You see dat falcon a-lighting,                           To heah ole Jordan roll.     
    than live to see that day, and yet he tried to escape in  his wife's skirts.           About this time the laws were very strict on the  slaves, and they were not allowed a pass to go to  a public gathering of any kind. Men who belonged  to one man and whose wives were owned by another, and  had been given a pass every Saturday night to go to  see them, were now permitted to go only once a month.  But the slaves would slip off to church and frolics and  the patrollers were continually after them, but the  slaves would play all kinds of tricks on them. I remember  one time while at a prayer meeting in an old  deserted cabin on the back part of a farm the slaves  were singing and praying, but had several stationed all  around the house, watching. They saw the patrollers  coming and notified those in the house, and to my surprise  five or six men had shovels, and each man got a  shovel full of hot embers out of the fireplace and  stood at the door and windows. They continued to  sing and pray until the patrollers got to the door  and ordered it opened. One man snatched the  door open while the others threw the fire all over  them; when the patrollers recovered consciousness  the slaves were all gone.            At another time I went to a dance in the woods; the  music consisted of tambourine, banjo and bones, but  before the dance began they tied grapevines across the  road, just high enough to catch a man riding horse  back across the face or neck. When they heard the  patrollers coming they ran, and the patrollers right  after them; many of them were crippled, but not a           slave was hurt or caught, So you see, there were  some negro as well as Yankee tricks.           The slaves would have to devise many schemes in  order to serve God. Of course they had church once  or twice a month, but some white man would do the  preaching, and his text would always be,  Servants  obey your masters,  But this was not what our  people wanted to hear, so they would congregate after  the white people had retired, when you would see them  with their cooking utensils, pots and kettles, go into a  swamp and put the pots and kettles on the fence, with  the mouths turned toward the worshipers. They would  sing and pray, the kettles catching the sound. In this  way they were not detected. I did not learn until  just before the war why they carried the vessels with  them to worship.           In order to notify the slaves on other farms when  there was going to be a meeting they would sing this  song, and the slaves would understand what it meant.  White people would think they were only singing for  amusement:             Get you ready, there's a meeting here tonight.  Matt. 7: 16.    1 Get you ready, there's a meeting here tonight,  	  2	Oh, hallelujah, to the lamb,  	  3	If ever I reach the mountain top,  	  4	Go down to the river when you're dry  	  5	You may hinder me here,          They would carry with them  iron lamps, with a greasy rag for a wick, and they would attach a sharp  spike to the lamp so as to stick it in a tree. In this  way they would light up the swamp, while they held  their meeting.       
     was found all mangled and bruised, with the rawhide grasped tightly in his hand. My brother says he only gasped once or twice after he was brought out.             When Nat. Turner's insurrection broke out, the colored people were forbidden to hold meetings among themselves. Nat. Turner was one of the slaves who had quite a large army; he was the captain to free his race. Notwithstanding our difficulties, we used to steal away to some of the quarters to have our meetings. One Sabbath I went on a plantation about five miles off, where a slave woman had lost a child the day before, and as it was to be buried that day, we went to the  great house  to get permission from the master if we could have the funeral then. He sent back word for us to bury the child without any funeral services. The child was deposited in the ground, and that night we went off nearly a mile to a lonely cabin on Griffin Furshee's plantation, where we assembled about fifty or seventy of us in number; we were so happy that we had to give vent to the feelings of our hearts, and were making more noise than we realized. The master, whose name was Griffin Furshee, had gone to bed, and being awakened by the noise, took his cane and his servant boy and came where the sound directed him. While I was exhorting, all at once the door opened and behold there he stood, with his white face looking in upon us. As soon as I saw the face I stopped suddenly, without even waiting to say amen.             The people were very much frightened; with throbbing hearts some of them went up the log chimney, others broke out through the back door, while a few, who were more self-composed, stood their ground.                     When the master came in, he wanted to know what we were doing there, and asked me if I knew that it was against the law for niggers to hold meetings. I expected every moment that he would fly at me with his cane; he did not, but only threatened to report me to my master. He soon left us to ourselves, and this was the last time be disturbed us in our meetings. His object in interrupting us was to find out whether we were plotting some scheme to raise an insurrection among the people. Before this, the white people held a quarterly meeting in the Fairfield Church, commencing Saturday, and continuing eight days and nights without cessation.             The religious excitement that existed at that time was so great that the people did not leave the church for their meals, but had them brought to them. There were many souls converted. The colored people attended every night. The white people occupied the part next to the altar, while the colored people took the part assigned them next to the door, where they held a protracted meeting among themselves. Sometimes, while we were praying, the white people would be singing, and when we were singing they would be praying; each gave full vent to their feelings, yet there was no discord or interruption with the two services. On Wednesday night, the fourth day from the commencement of the meeting, a colored woman by the name of Nancy Merrill, was converted, and when she experienced a change of heart she shouted aloud, rejoicing in the richness of her new found hope. Thursday night, the next evening, the meeting still continued.             By this time the excitement was on the increase           among both parties, and it bid fair to hold eight days longer; but right in the midst of the excitement some one came to the door of the church and nodded to the sexton to come to the door; as soon as he did go to the door some one there told him to speak to Nancy Merrill, the new convert, and tell her to come to the door, for he wanted to speak to her. She went, and, behold it was a slave trader, who had bought her during the day from her mistress! As soon as she went to the door, he seized and bound her, and then took her off to her cabin home to get her two boys he had bought also. The sexton came back and reported to us what had taken place.             This thrilling and shocking news sent a sharp shiver through every heart; it went through the church like wild-fire; it broke up the meeting entirely among both parties; in less than half an hour every one left the church for home. This woman had a daughter in Fairfield, where I learned my trade, and I hastened home, as soon as possible, to tell the girl what had happened to her mother. She was standing by the fire in the kitchen as I entered--she was the servant girl of John Langsdon, the man who taught me the shoemaker's trade. As soon as I related to her this sad news she fell to the floor as though she had been shot by a pistol; and, as soon as she had recovered a little from the shock we started for her mother's cabin home, reaching there just in time to see her mother and her two brothers take the vessel for Norfolk, to be sold. This was the last time we ever saw her; we heard, sometime afterwards, that a kind master had bought her and that she was doing well.                     Many thrilling scenes I could relate, if necessary, that makes my blood curdle in my veins while I write. We were treated like cattle, subject to the slave-holders' brutal treatment and law.             The wretched condition of the male slave is bad enough; but that of the woman, driven to unremitting, unrequited toil, suffering, sick, and bearing the peculiar burdens of her own sex, unpitied, not assisted, as well as the toils which belong to another, must arouse the spirit of sympathy in every heart not dead to all feeling. Oh! how many heart-rending prayers I have heard ascend up to the throne of grace for deliverance from such exhibitions of barbarity. How many family ties have been broken by the cruel hand of slavery. The priceless store of pleasures, and the associations connected with home were unknown to the doomed slaves, for in an unlooked for hour they were sold to be separated from father and mother, brothers and sisters. Oh! how many such partings have rent many a heart, causing it to bleed as it were, and crushing out all hope of ever seeing slavery abolished.             Sometime before I left for the north, the land of freedom, I appointed another meeting in an off house on a plantation not far from Heathsville, where a number of us collected together to sing and pray. After I had given out the hymn, and prayed, I commenced to exhort the people. While I did so I became very warm and zealous in the work, and perhaps made more noise than we were aware of. The patrolers  *                 *The patrolers were southern spies, sent out, or were wont to roam at night to hunt up runaway slaves, and to investigate other matters.     going along the road, about half a mile off, heard the sound           and followed it where we were holding our meeting. They came, armed to the teeth, and surrounded the house. The captain of the company came in, and as soon as we saw him we fell on our knees and prayed that God might deliver us. While we prayed he stood there in the middle of the floor, without saying a word. Pretty soon we saw that his knees began to tremble, for it was too hot for him, so he turned and went out. His comrades asked him if  he was going to make an arrest;  he said  no, it was too hot there for him.  They soon left, and that was the last we saw of them.             As God had delivered us in such a powerful manner, we took courage and held our meeting until day-break. Another time I had a meeting appointed at a freedwoman's house, whose name was Sister Gouldman, about five miles in the country. I left home about seven o'clock on Saturday evening, and arrived there about ten; we immediately commenced the meeting and continued it till about daylight. After closing the meeting we slept while Sister Gouldman was preparing the breakfast. After breakfast we went two miles further, and held another meeting till late in the afternoon, then closed and started for home, reaching there some time during the night. I was very much fatigued, and my energies were entirely exhausted, so much so that I was not able to work the next day.             The time when I was eighteen years old, when such a miraculous change had been wrought in my heart, I had had two holidays, and was up all night holding meetings, praying and singing most of the time. Not having any sleep, I could scarcely keep my eyes open when I went to work. While endeavoring to finish a      
     of him as a preacher. A day was appointed when he should exhibit his gifts to the assembled members of the church. Sitting around with ears more than usually critical, yet not without sympathy, they listened while Anthony addressed to them an exhortation from the desk. His effort proved satisfactory, and, at the close, pastor and brethren, taking him by the hand, bade him God speed. Thenceforth he exercised his now office as he had opportunity. Gathering a little congregation of slaves, sometimes in the kitchen of a friendly white person, sometimes in the rude cabin of a slave, he would lead them in their devotions and speak to them of the Gospel. These meetings, however, as well as all other assemblies consisting exclusively of slaves, were violations of Virginia law. Every such assembly, unless sanctioned by the presence of a white, was exposed to rude interruption, and the slaves that might be caught, to severe punishment. The patrols and guards that nightly walked their rounds were constantly on the watch to detect these secret meetings, and, in spite of all caution, they would occasionally succeed. Perhaps while the assembly were in the act of prayer, the door would be suddenly burst open by a throng of profane officials, each with cord in hand, bent on securing as many victims as possible. When such  surprisals  occurred, the first movement would be to extinguish the lights; then, through door, window, and even chimney, the affrighted worshippers hurried their escape. Those who were           unlucky enough to be caught, were taken to the cage,  1      1 A place provided everywhere in towns at the South, for the temporary confinement of delinquent slaves.   and the next day rewarded with nine-and-thirty lashes at the whipping post for having peacefully, but unlawfully, assembled to worship God. Anthony was not without experience of this sort, though he was always so fortunate as to escape from the clutches of the officers.             In his new capacity, it sometimes fell to his lot to perform the marriage rite for slaves, or what among them was called such; and sometimes to conduct the burial service for the dead. If a slave died during the week, no funeral was allowed to interrupt the daily toil of the plantation. The body, encased perchance in an orange-box, was deposited in the ground without ceremony or delay, and a few shovelfulls of earth were thrown in, while the bereaved kindred went about their toil as usual. But on the following Sabbath, the whole body of the slaves, attended by the master or the overseer, assembled to  sod the grave.  With prayers, exhortations, and much singing of hymns, in the sad, wild negro airs, this final ceremony was completed.             In death as in life, the social distinctions of slavery are carefully maintained. Laid to rest in a  potter's field,  the dead bodies of the slaves .never mingle their dust with that of the sovereign race. No monument, inscribed with the name of the deceased, ever marks the spot where he lies, as      
      the slaveholders. It was something which they could not understand. It brought glad tidings to the poor bond-man; it bound up the broken-hearted it opened the prison doors to them that were bound, and let the captive go free.             As soon as it got among the slaves, it spread from plantation to plantation, until it reached ours, where there were but few who did not experience religion. The slaveholders, becoming much alarmed at this strange phenomenon, called a meeting, at which they appointed men to patrol the country, and break up these religious assemblies. This was done, and many a poor victim had his back severely cut, for simply going to a prayer meeting.             At length, Mr. Wagar bought at auction a man named Martin, who was a fiddler. As slaves are very fond of dancing, our master thought that fiddling would bring them back to their former ignorant condition and bought this man for that purpose. It had the desired effect upon most of them, and what the whip failed to accomplish, the fiddle completed, for it is no easy matter to drive a soul from God by cruelty, when it may easily be drawn away by worldly pleasures; and fiddling I think is better appropriated to this purpose, than anything else could mention.      CHAP. III.             MR. W. was. a very cruel slave driver. He would whip unreasonably and without cause. He was often     
      prayer for colleges. At this concert, in the year 1834, a six o'clock morning prayer-meeting was appointed. When the pastor came, he found that Phebe had been there,  on the door steps more than an hour praying!  While it was yet dark, she found her way to the  prayer-meeting, as Mary to the sepulchre. Who can tell how many souls were converted in answer to the prayers on that door-step--how much they had to do with those conversions  in college which occurred at this time, and the fruits of which may be seen in the ministers scattered abroad, preaching the gospel, gathering souls into the kingdom of Christ? Those  seasons of revivals in college, have they no connection with the prayers of this humble saint, who lived to pray: lived in obscurity, and yet lived for the college; lived for the  church; lived for the pastor; lived for the world?             Phebe  loved the church and female prayer-meeting.  Through the storm and wind and bad walking, she would find her way to the place of prayer. In the female prayer-meeting, all  loved to kneel when Phebe prayed. She approached the throne of grace as if her mind and heart were already there, and she had only to open her lips and the prayer of the heart  ascended, in humility and faith and love. The last Sabbath she spent on earth she was at church as usual, and stopped at noon, and was conversing on the value and importance of  this meeting. She then alluded to a time, about four years since, when  she could not hold her peace.  About this time Phebe seemed more fully than ever before to receive Christ as  an all-sufficient, present Saviour. The blessings of His salvation seemed as much her own, as if she alone was heir to the redemption purchased by Christ. She  knew in whom she  believed,  and that  He was able to make all grace abound toward her.  Grace was triumphant in her soul, and so continued, by her own testimony given at her last interview  with her Christian friends. From this time, as she often expressed it,  she had never let her Saviour go;   she had held Him by the hand,  nay more,  He had come into her heart, and continued      
    I did not then know precisely what was the cause of these scenes, for I could not get any very satisfactory information concerning the matter from my master, only that some of the slaves had undertaken to kill their owners; but I have since learned that it was the famous Nat Turner's insurrection that caused all the excitement I witnessed. Slaves were whipped, hung, and cut down with swords in the streets, if found away from their quarters after dark. The whole city was in the utmost confusion and dismay; and a dark cloud of terrific blackness, seemed to hang over the heads of the whites. So true is it, that  the wicked flee when no man pursueth.  Great numbers of the slaves were locked in the prison, and many were  half hung,  as it was termed; that is, they were suspended to some limb of a tree, with a rope about their necks, so adjusted as not to quite strangle them, and then they were pelted by the men and boys with rotten eggs. This half-hanging is a refined species of cruelty, peculiar to slavery, I believe.            Among the cruelties occasioned by this insurrection, which was however some distance from Richmond, was the forbidding of as many as five slaves to meet together, except they were at work, and the silencing of all colored preachers. One of that class in our city, refused to obey the imperial mandate, and was severely whipped; but his religion was too deeply rooted to be thus driven from him, and no promise could be extorted from his resolute soul, that he would not proclaim what he considered the glad tidings of the gospel. (Query. How many white preachers would continue their employment, if they were served in the same way?) It is strange that more insurrections do          not take place among the slaves; but their masters have impressed upon their minds so forcibly the fact, that the United States Government is pledged to put them down, in case they should attempt any such movement, that they have no heart to contend against such fearful odds; and yet the slaveholder lives in constant dread of such an event.  *               * In proof of this, I would state that during my residence at the South, a whole town was once thrown into an uproar by my entering a slave hut, about Christmas time, and talking and praying with the inmates about an hour. I was told that it would not be safe for me to remain in the town over night. C. S.               The rustling of       ----the lightest leaf,         fills his timid soul with visions of flowing blood and burning dwellings; and as the loud thunder of heaven rolls over his head, and the vivid lightning flashes across his pale face, straightway his imagination conjures up terrible scenes of the loud roaring of an enemy's cannon, and the fierce yells of an infuriated slave population, rushing to vengeance.  **                **  While at the South, a gentleman came one day to a friend of mine, and in a very excited manner said to him,  Why, are you not afraid to have that man about you? Do you not fear that your house will be burned? I cannot sleep nights lest the slaves should rise and burn all before them.  C. S.    There is no doubt but this would be the case, if it were not for the Northern people, who are ready, as I have been often told, to shoot us down, if we attempt to rise and obtain our freedom. I believe that if the slaves could do as they wish, they would throw off their heavy yoke immediately, by rising against their masters; but ten millions of Northern people stand with their feet on     
   giving good advice, spiritually and morally, and were beloved by their colored congregations. I remember one whose name was W. G. Cooper, who was so well admired by his colored flock that they raised forty-five dollars and presented him a suit of clothes, when he went to conference, and sent a petition to have him returned to that charge.           Nearly every slave made some money which he could spend for fine clothes or such other things suited to his taste, so that when attending church I remember that the slaves were dressed almost as nicely as their owners, at any rate they looked as well as I have seen them on like occasions since they have been free.           We had some colored preachers, too, who held prayer meetings in their quarters and preached every Sunday afternoon in the white people's church, but there was always some leading white man present to take note of what the preacher said. If he used words deemed insubordinate or not in keeping with the pro-slavery idea, he was promptly stopped, there and then, and lectured for his mistake, and in some cases his license was recalled. Of course these licenses were granted by his master to preach during good behavior. Not three in ten of these preachers could read their texts or any other part of the Bible, but they stood in the pulpit, opened the Bible, gave out the song which did not always fit the tune, and delivered prayer with much force and in language that, while not the choicest, greatly impressed its hearers.           There were a few colored men who could read the Bible, in and around Brunswick at that time, but none of them were preachers. The men who felt themselves called to preach had no education at all, but had a fair        amount of brain, good memories, were fluent talkers, and considered pious and truthful. They could line a hymn from memory as clearly as their masters could from their books, and take a text and state were it was to be found.           I  remember a story told on Uncle Tom Ewing, an old colored preacher, who was praying on one  occassion , after the close of his sermon, in the church near Jacob Vennable's place, five miles from Brunswick. The old fellow got warmed up, and used the words,  Free indeed, free from death, free from hell, free from work, free from the white folks, free from everything.  After the meeting closed, Jacob Vennable, who sat in front of the pulpit took Tom to task and threatened to have his license revoked if he ever used such language in public. Jacob Vennable was a slave holder and considered a fair master, so I was informed by Jesse, one of his slaves, and others who were supposed to know. I heard Uncle Tom preach and pray many times after the above-described occurrence, but never heard him use the words quoted above.           I remember when a question as to the purity of Christians (whether two clean sheets could soil each other) was being agitated among the colored people in the Bluff, as the hilly portion of the country, five miles east of Brunswick, was then called  It was argued pro and con with considerable warmth on both sides by the preachers and lay members. Considerable excitement was created thereby, and pending this the white men called a meeting and ordered some of the leading advocates of this new doctrine to appear before them, and they were then and there notified that if they did not stop that kind of talk, they, the white people,        would whip every man who favored the clean sheet idea. That ended the new idea and I heard no more of it. I was then living on a farm in that neighborhood and know whereof  I speak.           There is this to be said for the slaveholders in that part of the country, at least, that they believed in having their slave women live a virtuous life, and encouraged  them in getting married, and did not under any circumstances allow plural marriages among them. Of course there would be occasionally a strange freak, a black mother with a very light-colored child, whose real father's name was never stated, but these cases were rare, the exception rather than the rule. When two lovers became engaged, the consent of the girl's parents, and that of both masters, if they belonged to different owners, had to be obtained. Then the girl's master would give them a wedding supper, and invite a few of his white friends, who would dine first, then the bridal party and their invited guests. The ceremony was usually performed by a colored preacher. After supper dancing commenced, which lasted until a late hour, when they would disperse. The master had built and furnished a cabin for the couple, and when the time came to retire, they were conducted to their cabin and left, after receiving many blessings.           I have stated in this chapter, that there were many masters who encouraged slave girls in their efforts to live virtuous lives, and in a former chapter, I stated that there were thousands of high-toned families, although held in slavery by the laws of the land, and who clearly understood their helpless condition, and yet, by reason of having superior blood in their veins, were enabled thereby to attain the very best conditions possible     
      impart to him so much of the mystery as I had been able to penetrate. Thus the light of this grand movement broke in upon my mind by degrees; and I must say that ignorant as I was of the philosophy of that movement, I believed in it from the first, and I believed in it, partly, because I saw that it alarmed the consciences of the slaveholders. The insurrection  of Nat. Turner had been quelled, but the alarm and terror  which it occasioned had not subsided. The cholera was then on its way to this country, and I remember thinking that God was angry with the white people because of their  slaveholding wickedness, and therefore his judgments were abroad in the land. Of course it was impossible for me not to hope much for the abolition movement when I saw it supported by the Almighty, and armed with DEATH.             Previously to my contemplation of the anti-slavery movement  and its probable results, my mind had been seriously awakened to the subject of religion. I was not more than thirteen years old, when in my loneliness and destitution I longed for some one to whom I could go, as to a father and protector. The preaching of a white Methodist minister, named Hanson, was the means of causing me to feel that in God I had such a friend. He thought that all men, great and small, bond and free, were sinners in the sight of God: that they were by nature rebels against his government; and that they must repent of their sins, and be reconciled to God through Christ. I cannot say that I had a very distinct notion of what was required of me, but one thing I did know well: I was wretched and had no means of making myself otherwise. I consulted a good colored man named Charles Lawson,  and in tones of holy affection he told me to pray, and to  cast all my care upon God.  This I sought to do; and though for weeks I was a poor, broken-hearted mourner,  traveling through doubts and fears, I finally found my burden lightened, and my heart relieved. I loved all mankind, slaveholders  not excepted, though I abhorred slavery more than ever. I saw the world in a new light, and my great concern           was to have everybody converted. My desire to learn increased,  and especially, did I want a thorough acquaintance with the contents of the Bible. I have gathered scattered pages of the Bible from the filthy street-gutters, and washed and dried them, that in moments of leisure I might get a word or two of wisdom from them. While thus religiously seeking knowledge, I became acquainted with a good old  colored man named Lawson. This man not only prayed three times a day, but he prayed as he walked through the streets, at his work, on his dray--everywhere. His life was a life of prayer, and his words when he spoke to any one, were about a better world. Uncle Lawson lived near Master Hugh's house, and becoming deeply attached to him, I went often with him to prayer-meeting, and spent much of my leisure time with him on Sunday. The old man could read a little, and I was a great help to him in making out the hard words, for I was a better reader than he. I could teach him  the letter,  but he could teach me  the spirit,  and refreshing times we had together, in singing and praying. These meetings went on for a long time without the knowledge of Master Hugh or my mistress. Both knew, however, that I had become religious, and seemed to respect my conscientious piety. My mistress was still a professor of religion, and belonged to class. Her leader was no less a person than Rev. Beverly Waugh, the presiding elder, and afterwards one of the bishops of the Methodist Episcopal church.             In view of the cares and anxieties incident to the life she was leading, and especially in view of the separation from religious associations to which she was subjected, my mistress had, as I have before stated, become lukewarm, and needed to be looked up by her leader. This often brought Mr. Waugh to our house, and gave me an opportunity to hear him exhort and pray. But my chief instructor in religious matters was Uncle Lawson. He was my spiritual father and I loved him intensely, and was at his house every chance I could get. This pleasure, however, was not long unquestioned. Master           Hugh became averse to our intimacy, and threatened to whip me if I ever went there again. I now felt myself persecuted by a wicked man, and I  would  go. The good old man had told me that the  Lord had a great work for me to do,  and I must prepare to do it; that he had been shown that I must preach the gospel. His words made a very deep impression upon me, and I verily felt that some such work was before me, though I could not see how I could ever engage in its performance.  The good Lord would bring it to pass in his own good time,  he said, and that I must go on reading and studying the scriptures. This advice and these suggestions were not without their influence on my character and destiny. He fanned my already intense love of knowledge into a flame by assuring me that I was to be a useful man in the world. When I would say to him,  How can these things be? and what can I do?  his simple reply, was,   Trust in the Lord .  When I would tell him,  I am a slave, and a slave for life, how can I do anything?  he would quietly answer,  The  Lord  can make you free, my dear; all things are possible with Him; only have  faith  in God.'Ask, and it shall be given you.' If you want liberty, ask the Lord for it  in  FAITH,  and he will give it to you .              Thus assured and thus cheered on under the inspiration of hope, I worked and prayed with a light heart, believing that my life was under the guidance of a wisdom higher than my own. With all other blessings sought at the mercy seat, I always prayed that God would, of his great mercy and in his own good time, deliver me from my bondage.             I went, one day, on the wharf of Mr. Waters, and seeing two Irishmen unloading a scow of stone or ballast, I went on board unasked, and helped them. When we had finished the work one of the men came to me, aside, and asked me a number of questions, and among them if I were a slave? I told him  I was a slave for life.  The good Irishman gave a shrug, and seemed deeply affected. He said it was a pity so fine a little fellow as I was should be a slave for life. They both had much to say about the matter, and expressed the     
   the day time just before the fall of the tide, so as to obstruct the return of the fish, which had been thus thrown up, leaving them in the mud when the water receded. A fine stock one night he found there, and, gathering them into his great basket, a heavy  gah,  an excellent rough skinned fish, escaped from his grasp in the darkness, although he had hold of it several times. After the moon was up, and John was at the place again, he discovered there a water snake eight feet long, so glutted with the fish it had eaten as now to be harmless. His preservation from its terrible bite was marvelous to him, handling it so unsuspiciously as he had done. He then cut a stick with two long prongs, pinned the snake fast into the ground, and cut it in two. In a few days, the numerous turkey buzzards that were flying over the island, the carrion attracting them, caused him to bury it, lest the spot should be visited to ascertain the cause.           One day, mending his clothes beneath a tree, a bright object in one opposite caught his notice, and he discovered the eyes of a snake intently watching him. He moved off, and the long snake, gracefully unwinding from the beautiful ash branch around which it was coiled, descended to the ground. John was ready with his fork, and, securing the cow-sucker, he was freed from its embraces till he could dispatch it. These reptiles were provoking pests to the farmers, winding themselves around cows sometimes and draining them dry,           John mentions  Nat Turner's insurrection  as fresh in his mind, because the slaves after that were more strictly watched than ever, their usual privileges denied them, and their hardships greatly increased.           Nat Turner was a slave who secreted himself from his master 30 years, living in a habitation he had constructed        under the ground in Southampton County. He was an exhorter early, and had acquired great influence over the slaves, and this he used to incite them, to combine and to murder their masters and their families, and thus free themselves from slavery. Several whole families were sacrificed to this horrid and cruel infatuation 'ere its leaders were discovered, and severe retribution was dealt to all supposed to have knowledge of the plot. John was seized by the city guard, being out after eight o'clock, and thrown into prison, but being recognized by the captain, to whom he was taken, and his good faith proved, he was returned unharmed to his master's domains.           The State Government soon after enacted a law prohibiting colored men entirely from preaching and exhorting, or even gathering for prayer meetings, except at the leaves of their respective owners. These were hard laws to submit to, their situation as slaves being made bearable to some only by the soothing counsels and influence of their christian brethren. But the moral courage of a few of the preachers rose superior to the laws of the land, when they were in violation of the laws of God as revealed in the Scriptures. Among such men was one Pleasant Randall, the property of Mr. Harrison, of Charles City, who deemed his commission to make the Gospel known to sinners, to be from the Lord, and not from man.           When gone into Prince George County, one Saturday, to preach for a couple of days, the planters in the vicinity visited his master, Mr. Harrison, urging him to restrain Randall, or shut him up, saying, that his preaching so affected their people that they would bear beating and beating, and then hear him again at the first opportunity--they could not thus spare their time, and the man ought, by the laws, to be hung--and  they  should do something to        stop him, if he did not. Mr. Harrison was personally attached to the good man, and told them, that no  mob  should touch him; they must proceed according to law if they meant to hinder his preaching. So Randall was arrested, imprisoned, and tried, and convicted, and condemned to be hung, for making eternal salvation known to his fellows, and an early day was fixed for his execution.           At this conclusion of the matter, Mr. H. went to Richmond to obtain from the Governor, if possible, his reprieve.           The Governor said it was a trying case, truly, but he must see, he supposed, to the execution of the laws of the State of which he was governor.           Mr. Harrison continued to plead for him, extolling his true piety, and many noble qualities. Finally, the Governor said,  Bring him to me, I want to see him,  and he forthwith prepared the document for summoning him.--The doors of the Richmond jail opened at the command of the Governor, and a guard attending the devoted culprit, was brought into Magisterial presence.            So you are the man that won't stop preaching,  said the Governor to Randall.  Yes, massa,  he replied,  I mean to preach as long as the Lord God gives me breath.   Can you preach,  the Governor again interrogated.  Yes, massa, I can, the Lord sent me to preach, and helps me.   Well, let us hear you, then,  said he, thinking, perhaps, to have some merriment. He took for his text,  The earth is the Lord's,  and preached an hour before his Excellency, who was in no light mood when the discourse was ended, and a fervent prayer had been offered in his behalf to the Lord of Heaven and earth. Gov. C. sent him out of the room, and said to Mr. H-- It is a shame to hang such a man. It would be a scandal to Virginia. I cannot do it,        or consent to it. But condemned by the laws of the State in which he lives, you know he is  yours  no longer, and pardoning him as I now do, he is a free man, indeed.  After this the colored people built him a church in Blandford, and thus the Lord increased his usefulness by the very means intended to end it, and he was there ministering when John came away.           It may be said to the credit of Virginia's statesmen that this iniquitous law did not continue long in force.           John speaks of a Mr. Bradley, in Chesterfield County, whom he knew in his youth as a notedly brutal master.--When angry, he would heat a poker in the fire, and lay it himself on the naked backs of his poor slaves, but his good wife mourned his cruelty, and did all in her power to alleviate their sorrows and their sufferings.           This man one time, at the solicitation of his wife, attended her to a camp meeting. By the words there heard, he was so wrought upon in view of his sins, that John, with others, had to carry him to his home, where, for three days, his terror was so great that no one ventured near him.--Then he opened his mouth in praises to God for sparing a wretch like him. He called his slaves together, and asked their forgiveness for his barbarity--said Satan had moved him hitherto, but Christ now was in his soul. His kindness and christian character ever after proved the change to be genuine, and from being hated and feared, he was beloved and truly lamented when his death took place, and to John and to many persons his conversion was blessed, attesting to them the nature of that religion which could convert a lion into a lamb.           The Guilfield church alluded to heretofore, is just out of Petersburg, and was erected by the labors and the contributions of the colored people of Petersburg. John's own hands     
   I know nothing of the others, nor am I likely ever to hear of them again.          The treatment of slaves is mildest near the borders, where the free and slave states join: it becomes more severe, the further we go from the free states. It is more severe in the west and south than where I lived. The sale of slaves most frequently takes place from the milder to the severer parts: in that directtion,  there is great traffic in slaves, which is carried on by the speculators. On the frontier between the slave and free states there is a guard; no coloured person can go over a ferry without a pass. By these regulations, and the great numbers of patrols, escape is made very difficult.          Formerly slaves were allowed to have religious  meetings of their own; but after the insurrection which I spoke of before, they were forbidden to meet even for worship. Often they are flogged, if they are found singing or praying at home. They may go to the places of worship used by the whites; but they like their own meetings better. My wife's brother Isaac        was a coloured preacher. A number of slaves went privately into the wood to hold meetings; when they were found out, they were flogged, and each was forced to tell who else was there. Three were shot, two of whom were killed, and the other was badly wounded. For preaching to them, Isaac was flogged, and his back pickled; when he was nearly well, he was flogged and pickled again, and so on for some months; then his back was suffered to get well, and he was sold. A little while before this, his wife was sold away with an infant at her breast; and of his six children,  four had been sold away by one at a time. On the way with his buyers he dropped down dead; his heart was broken.          Having thus narrated what has happened to myself, my relatives, and near friends, I will add a few matters about slaves and coloured persons in general.          Slaves are under fear in every word they speak. If in their master's kitchen they let slip an expression of discontent, or a wish for freedom, it is often reported to the master or mistress by the children of the family, who may     
     value of his services there, it has been remarked,  no one but a dealer in tobacco can form an idea. Notwithstanding the hundreds of hogsheads that were committed to his charge, he could produce any one the instant it was called for; and the shipments were made with a promptness and correctness, such as no person, white or black, has equalled in the same situation.   *        * It is said, that while employed at the warehouse, he often devoted his leisure time to reading, and that a gentleman, on one occasion, taking up a book which he had left for a few moments, found it to be  Smith's Wealth of Nations.              As early as the year 1815, he began to feel a special interest in the cause of African Missions, and contributed probably more than any other person, in giving origin and character to the African Missionary Society established during that year in Richmond, and which has, for many years, collected and appropriated annually, to the cause of Christianity in Africa, from one hundred, to one hundred and fifty dollars. His benevolence was practical; and whenever and wherever good objects were to be effected, he was ready to lend his aid. He became a preacher several years before he left this country, and generally engaged in this service every Sabbath, among the colored people on plantations a few miles from Richmond.             A correspondent, from whom we have already quoted, observes,  In preaching, notwithstanding his grammatical inaccuracies, he was often truly eloquent. He had derived almost nothing from the schools, and his manner was of course unpolished, but his ideas would sometimes burst upon you in their native solemnity, and awaken deeper feelings than the most polished, but less original and inartificial discourse.  A distinguished Minister of the Presbyterian Church, said to the writer,  A sermon which I heard from Mr. Cary, shortly before he sailed for Africa, was the best extemporaneous sermon I ever heard. It contained more original and impressive thoughts, some of which are distinct in my memory, and never can be forgotten.              Mr. Cary was among the earliest emigrants to Africa. For some time before his departure he had sustained the office of Pastor of a Baptist Church of colored persons in Richmond, embracing nearly eight hundred members, received from it a liberal support, and enjoyed its confidence and affection.-- When an intelligent Minister of the same Church inquired, why he could determine to quit a station of so much comfort and usefulness, to encounter the dangers of an African climate, and hazard every thing to plant a Colony on a distant heathen shore? His reply was to this effect,  I am an African, and in in this country, however meritorious my conduct, and respectable my character, I cannot receive the credit due to either. I wish to go to a country where I shall be estimated by my merits, not by my complexion; and I feel bound to labor for my suffering race.  He seemed to have imbibed the sentiment of Paul, and to have great heaviness and continual sorrow in his heart, for his brethren, his kinsmen according to the flesh.         
     bondage. Though the parting was painful, it afforded her  solace in the contemplation of her husband becoming a free man, and cherishing a hope that her little family, through the aid of some angel of mercy, might be enabled to make their escape also, and meet to part no more on earth. My father came to spend the night with us, according to his usual custom. It was the last time, and sadness brooded upon his brow. It was the  only opportunity he had to make his escape without suspicion  and detection, as he was immediately to fall into the hands of a new master. He had never been sold from the place of his birth before, and was determined never to be sold again if God would verify his promise. My father was not educated, but  was a preacher, and administered the Word of God according to  the dictation and revelation of the spirit. His former master  had allowed him the privilege of holding meetings in the village within the limits of his pass on the Sundays when he visited my mother. But on this Saturday evening he arrived and gave us  all his farewell kiss and hurried away. My mother's people were aware of my father's intention, but rather than spare my mother, and for fear she might be detected, they secreted his escape. His master called a number of times and enquired for  him and strongly pressed my mother to give him an account of  my father, but she never gave it. We waited patiently, hoping  to learn if he succeeded in gaining his freedom. Many anxious  weeks and months passed before we could get any tidings from  him, until at length my mother heard that he was in Chicago, a  free man and preaching the Gospel. He made every effort to  get his family, but all in vain. The spirit of slavery so strongly  existed that letters could not reach her; they were all destroyed .  My parents had never learned the rescuing scheme of the  underground railroad which had borne so many thousands to the  standard of freedom and victories. They knew no other  resource than to depend upon their own chance in running away  and secreting themselves. If caught they were in a worse  condition than before.        
     months when he sold me, or rather traded me, to George H. Hess, a wealthy farmer of the vicinity of Fort Plain.  I was bartered in exchange for a yoke of steers, a colt and some additional property, the nature and amount of  which I have now forgotten. I remained with Master Hess from March until June of the same year, when I ran away.  My master had worked me hard, and at last undertook to whip me. This led me to seek escape from slavery. I arose  in the night, and taking the then newly staked line of the Erie canal for my route, traveled along it westward until,  about a week later, I reached the village of Lockport. No one had stopped me in my flight. Men were at work digging  the new canal at many points, but they never troubled themselves even to question me. I slept in barns at night and  begged food at farmers' houses along my route. At Lockport a colored man showed me the way to the Canadian border. I  crossed the Niagara at Youngstown on the ferry boat, and was free!            Once on free soil, I began to look about for work, and found it at a point called Deep Cut on the Welland Canal,  which they were then digging. I found the laborers a rough lot and soon had a mind to leave them. After three months  had passed, I supposed it safe to return to the American side, and acting on the idea I recrossed the river. A farmer  named Rich, residing near Youngstown, engaged me as a wood chopper. In the spring I made my way to Rochesterville and  found a home with Lawyer Talbert. The chores about his place were left to me, and I performed the same service for  Orlando Hastings. I was then nineteen years of age. As a slave I had never been inside of a school or a church, and I knew nothing of letters or religion. The wish to learn awoke in me almost from the moment I set foot in the place, and I soon obtained an excellent chance to carry the wish into effect. After the opening of the Erie canal, I obtained work in the warehouse of the Hudson and Erie line and found a home with its manager, Mr. Pliny Allen Wheeler. I was taught to read by Mr. Freeman, who had opened a Sunday school of his own for colored youths, on West Main street, or Buffalo street as it was then called. But my self-education advanced fastest in the warehouse during the long winter and spring months when the canal was closed and my only work consisted of chores about the place and at my employer's residence. The clerks helped me whenever I needed help in my studies. Soon I had learning enough to be placed in charge of the freight business of the warehouse, with full direction over the lading of boats. I became a member of the African Methodist Episcopal Society in 1823, when the church was on Ely street, and my studies soon took the direction of           preparation for the ministry. In 1828 I taught a school for colored children on Favor street, and I began holding meetings at the same time. In the following year I first formally  commenced preaching, and in 1830 I bought as a site for a religious edifice the lot now occupied by Zion's  church [.]  In the meantime the Ely street society had ceased to exist,  its death having been hastened by internal quarrels and by dishonesty among its trustees. On the lot already  mentioned, I built a small church edifice, which was afterwards displaced by a larger one, the latter finally  giving way to the present structure on the same site. I was ordained as a minister  in May, 1833, by Bishop Rush.  I had been called Tom as a slave and they called me Jim at the warehouse. I put both together when I reached manhood  and was ordained as Rev. Thomas James.            Two years before the last mentioned event in my life, Judge Sampson, vice-president of the local branch of the  African Colonization Society of that day, turned over to me a batch of anti-slavery literature sent him by Arthur  Tappan. It was these documents that turned my thoughts into a channel which they never quitted until the colored man became the equal of the white in the eye of the law, if not in the sight of his neighbor of another race. In the early summer of 1833 we held the first of a series of anti-slavery meetings in the court house. The leading promoters of that meeting were William Bloss, Dr. Reid--whose widow now in the 86th year of her age still lives in Rochester--and Dr. W. Smith. There was a great crowd in attendance on the first night, but its leading motive was curiosity and it listened without interfering with the proceedings. The second night we were plied with questions, and on the third they drowned with their noise the voices of the speakers and finally turned out the lights. Not to be baulked of his purpose, Mr. Bloss, who was not a man to be cowed by opposition, engaged the session room of the Third Presbyterian church, but even there we were forced to lock the doors before we could hold our abolition meeting in peace. There we organized our anti-slavery society, and when the journals of the day refused to publish our constitution and by-laws, we bought a press for a paper of our own and appointed the three leaders already named to conduct it. It was printed fortnightly and was called  The Rights of Man.  I was sent out to make a tour of the county in its interest, obtaining subscriptions for the paper and lecturing against slavery. At Le Roy I was mobbed, my meeting was broken up and I was saved from worse treatment only by the active efforts of Mr. Henry Brewster, who secreted me in his own house. At the village I next visited, Warsaw, I was aided by Seth M. Gates and others, and I was also well received at Perry. At Pike, however, I was arrested      
      on Tuesday morning--this was Sunday night. His house was five  miles off.             Readers, just notice what I suffered as a man, and yet these trials were good for me. Col. Jones made me suffer, in his life-time, what few man have suffered. On one occasion, I submitted to let him tie and whip me. I asked him if he didn't think be he had whipped me enough.              When I am done with you it will be night,  he replied.             I did not know my strength; I flung my foot against the tree and broke loose and got away from him and the other white man, untied the knot with my teeth. I was tempted to kill him.             This was two years before I parted with him for good. There was a day when he would take no money for me. The first time he ever talked of selling me was when I asked him to let me have a wife on Dr. Roger's plantation. He never let me see any peace after the first four years.              Bretheren,  what a blessing it is to dwell together in the spirit. Beware how you entertain a stranger, for you may entertain an angel. Have you forgotten the life we lived when we were slaves? Our sufferings were great, and in some places we were not allowed to worship God at all. We had to have secret prayer meetings on Saturday nights, and some would have to watch for the patrolmen and hard task-masters, to keep from being surprised, while the others prayed and sung. When the enemy was seen the watch would give the alarm; we would then close the meeting and make our escape, in order to keep our backs from being slashed and salted down.             In Marsh county, N. C., we had a noble speaker by the name of Minger Crudemp; he was the slave of a popular Baptist Minister, who, although he was a preacher, did not allow his slaves to worship the God he praised. This Minger Crudemp would hold prayer-meetings every Saturday night that he had a chance in spite of the penalty he would have to pay if he was caught; they would run him Saturday and Sunday.  Bretheren , see how hard it was for us so serve God in the days of slavery. In some places they were allowed to praise God, but they had to have a white man to watch them. (When I was a small boy Bethey Thompson, a religious woman, was whipped by her mistress because she would pray and shout through the day.) Oh, how hard were the lives we led in those days. It was a common thing for slave men and women to run away into the woods to keep their masters from whipping them. To day,  bretheren , we ought to love one another and be the best friends and citizens in America. Just look at the mercy of God in the midst of all the Presidents during slavery; yet we were held in bondage. God reared up Abraham Lincoln--one whom the people had not looked for--who used more power than any of the men in America. He caused the  shackels  to be thrown off the bondmen.             There are few of you who have ever thought what it cost to set you free--hundreds and thousands of lives were lost; even our greatest man, Abraham Lincoln, fell. No other man did the will of God as he did; it seemed as if he was intended to liberate us. He arose     
      CHAPTER VIII.  MY EARLY LIFE IN THE MINISTRY.            SHORTLY after my conversion I was overcome with a feeling that I ought to preach. I strove for months to get rid of it, but without success. I  went to a man in whose piety and Christian virtue  I had much confidence and made known to him my  struggle and the feeling that was then strong upon  me. He gave me his sympathy and directed me to  a certain preacher for counsel and aid; but this man  did not believe in Negroes preaching, and he gave  me no encouragement. I next sought the advice of  a colored man whom the Methodists had helped.  He was a pure Christian man, and he told me that  if God had really called me to preach he surely knew  his own business better than man and advised me not  to trouble myself, but trust God. I did trust him;  and soon thereafter the inspiration came, and I firmly decided to enter upon the work of a minister.            I sent in my petition to a Quarterly Conference  of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, for  license to preach. The Conference did not grant  my request, but gave me license to exhort instead.  The committee explained that the Church did not  believe it proper to grant license to Negroes to  preach. Rev. George Harris was the presiding elder, and Rev. A.R. Wilson was the preacher in  charge of the local Church. Rev. Wilson was my         personal friend up to the time of his death, and he  took a lively interest in my career and my work. In  the early days of my ministry I regarded him as a  great and good man, and during all the years of  our acquaintance thereafter the esteem in which I  held him when I was a young man did not suffer in  any way.            During the Civil War the attitude of the Southern Methodist Church toward granting license to  Negroes to preach had undergone some changes,  and so I appeared again for license to preach.  This time I was sent before the Quarterly Conference presided over by Elder William H. Lee. After  asking many questions bearing upon almost every  phase of the doctrines of Christ and the Church, I  was granted license to preach. I recall many of the  questions that were asked and the answers that I  gave. I shall never forget the occasion and the keen  interest every one seemed to feel in the examination  I was called upon to take. I give below a few of  the questions and the answers that provoked considerable interest and discussion  -  viz.:             Question.  Are all men sinners?              Answer:  Yes.             Q.  What Scriptural proof or reference have you to offer?              A.   For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall  all be made alive.              Q.  Is conviction a voluntary act or an involuntary one?             A.  Involuntary.                    Q.  Can you give a Scriptural reference?             A.   The grace that brings salvation has appeared unto all men, teaching them godliness.              Q.  What is the difference between justification  and repentance?             A.  Justification is the work done for me, while regeneration is the work done in me. The former  takes place in the courts of heaven, while the latter  takes place in the human heart.            These questions, together with others somewhat similar, being satisfactorily answered, I was granted license to preach, and I felt a freedom that I had  not  enjoyed before.            I have already spoken of the prayer meetings and the splendid opportunity they afforded in exercising  the gifts that God had given me and the deepening  of the work of grace in our hearts. These meetings  proved to be a great preparation for the work that  I was called upon to do after I had entered fully  into the work of the Christian ministry. Being  licensed to preach, I was frequently called upon to  preach and exhort, especially on Sunday afternoons,  not only to my people, but the white people also  would come out in large numbers to hear me. At  first I was very much embarrassed to preach before  such large crowds, because I realized fully that I  was without education and had but little opportunity  of learning anything. But God helped me wonderfully and blessed my work.            From the time I was licensed to exhort up to  1865 I held meetings for our people. We had glorious         times, and many converts would rise and  tell  of Jesus and his love.  These meetings made our  country famous for Methodism during the war. At  some places we had stormy times. The old days of  the beginning of the Wesleyan Movement in England, in Ireland, and in Wales had their reflex in  these. Many times my life was in great danger,  and the white people were constantly being reviled  and reprimanded because they had encouraged me  in preaching. The persecutors went so far as to  burn down the church houses in which I had  preached to my people. But I had gone too far in  the work to be stopped by such methods. Too many  people, both white and colored, believed in me to be  sidetracked by any such methods; for at this time  not only Methodists, but Christian people of all  denominations, upheld me and sought to give encouragement. One good old Presbyterian brother said to me after I had preached in his church:   Brother Lane, keep on preaching the gospel, and  we will keep on building church houses until the  trumpet blows. Let them burn down. We will  build, and you shall preach.        
      primer, and Sunday morning he commenced learning me my letters. By Monday morning I could say them all. He would give me lessons nights and Sabbath mornings. He said when he used to take his master's children to school, he would carry his book in his hat and get the children to give him a lesson in the interval of the school. He grew up to be a young man, experienced religion, and joined the M. E. church, and was authorized to preach among his colored brethren, free and slave, and was set free some time before he worked for my father.             After he left our house I was without a teacher, and there was an old man about seventy-five or eighty years old, a slaveholder, owned a small farm and one slave woman married to a slave belonging to another slaveholder. This woman was the mother of two small children. Her old master had five daughters, one son eighteen years of age, a family of ten     
      that's the way ye all shout at the camp-ground. Shout away! you're gittin' happy now.              He beat her there, mockin' the while her cries of pain, till she became too much exhausted to utter another sound; and then, untying her, he delivered her to her mistress.  Thar, ma'am,  said he,  she ain't got use for no more this time. She's got the devil in her, but I reckon he'll keep still till she gits over this ere.              Much religious excitement existed at this time among the slaves in the neighborhood, and particularly upon the plantation of Mr. McKiernan. An old Baptist preacher, named Archie Eggleston, had been hired here the preceding year; and he had zealously preached to his brethren in bonds the love and compassion of Jesus; and had sought, in his simple way, to encourage them to hope for a home among  the spirits bright.  His language, it is true, was full of the quaint idioms of his race; but it spoke to the hearts of his unlearned auditory; for the little which he could tell them of the blessed Saviour was just what they loved to hear. They  received the word with gladness,  and, with its warm and cheering rays, it illumined their darkness, and strewed the thorny path they trod, not with the roses of content, but with the trembling violets of hope.             Sweet, when their daily toil was done, was the hour which, borrowed from their needed rest, they spent alone in prayer; and, as the breath of their humble souls ascended on the soft air of evening, their trusting hearts were filled with heavenly consolations.      
      consent of their masters. Then no matter how hard they worked  they had nothing which they could call their own. Even their  children did not belong to them. And they themselves were  liable to be sold away to a distant part of the country to a  master whom they did not know and who might be very cruel to  them. Then as there were no schools for us and as we could  not read you can see how we would want to go to camp meetings  or to church. So we were always glad when Sunday came. On  Sunday, masters and slaves all went to church together.             Our master was a very religious man, being a local preacher  in the Methodist church. Once every three months the  Presiding Elder used to visit the church and hold a quarterly  meeting after he had preached. On one of those visits an  incident occurred that I still remember even after so many  years. It showed how bitter our masters were toward any one  who sympathized with us. And it marked, too, the breaking off  of religious association between our part of the South and  the North.      III             I cannot remember when the church incident with relation to  the Presiding Elder occurred, but it could not have been so  very long before the beginning of the war. We slaves used to  go to the same church our master and the other plantation  owners attended. Of course we used to sit back by the door  by ourselves while they sat up front. The church was about  five miles away from our plantation. We slaves used to walk  while our masters rode. This Sunday for some reason they  left me at home. But after they were gone I happened to  think of a donkey I often rode and the thought occurred to me  that I might ride him to church. So I got on his back and  started off. He carried me to church in good style but when  we reached there instead of waiting for me to get off he  threw me off. I had no rope to tie him, so I left him outside  and went in the church. The result was that he got in a fight  with another donkey while the church services was in progress  and created such a disturbance that I was later given a  severe whipping for it.             But another thing happened during that service which caused  a greater commotion than my donkey. Mr. Ayers, the Presiding  Elder, called upon a colored man named Ennis Dilamar to pray.  Ennis was a slave who had recently been purchased by my  master and who had quite a local reputation as a religious  man. The fact that Mr. Ayers should call upon a slave to pray  caused great offense to the plantation owners and after the  service was over and while the masters and their families  were arranging themselves on the ground to eat their dinner,  my master called Ennis to him and asked him what he meant by  asking God to send the time when Ethiopia should stretch  forth her arm like an army with banners, and said that he  would teach him better than to use such words as that. Of  course Ennis could not make any reply to this. He had simply  been repeating what he had heard some white man say, because  he himself could neither read nor write. However, they gave  him a severe whipping right then and there. This seemed to  disturb Mr. Ayers very much. He withdrew from the company and  went over to where the slaves were preparing their dinner and  told them that he did not see why a Christian man could not  be allowed to use his gift of prayer even if he was black.  In some way this remark got to the white people. So when the  afternoon meeting was called my master told Mr. Ayers that  his service was no longer wanted and that he need not visit  the church any more. From that time on my master had charge  of the meetings as local preacher and we never saw Mr. Ayers  again.             This incident, as I say, must have happened a short time  before the beginning of the war, because shortly afterwards  Samuel Hymans, a young man from our community who was  attending West Point, came home for a vacation, but when the  vacation was over he did not return to West Point. Instead  he commenced to organize a company of soldiers. I was very  anxious to go with him as his servant and my master, at his  request, let me do so. The reason why I was anxious to go  with Hymans was because I wanted to learn how to drill. I did  learn to drill. In fact I learned how to drill so well that  after a while when he was busy with other matters he would  tell me to drill the company for him. After Fort Sumpter      
     to avoid exciting his evil passions. While learning the shoemaker's trade, I was about eighteen years old. At this time I became deeply interested in my soul's salvation; the white people held a prayer meeting in Fairfield one evening in a private house; I attended the meeting that evening, but was not permitted to go in the same room, but only allowed to go in an adjoining room. While there I found peace in believing, and in this happy state of mind I went home rejoicing and praising the Lord for what he had done for me. A few  Sabbath's  following, I united with the Church in Fairfield. Soon after I was converted I commenced holding meetings among the people, and it was not long before my fame began to spread as an exhorter. I was very zealous, so much so that I used to hold meetings all night, especially if there were any concerned about their immortal soul.             I remember in one instance that having quit work about sundown on a Saturday evening, I prepared to go ten miles to hold a prayer meeting at Sister Gould's. Quite a number assembled in the little cabin, and we continued to sing and pray till daybreak, when it broke. All went to their homes, and I got about an hour's rest while Sister Gould was preparing breakfast. Having partaken of the meal, she, her daughter and myself set out to hold another meeting two miles further; this lasted till about five o'clock, when we returned. Then I had to walk back ten miles to my home, making in all twenty-four miles that day. How I ever did it, lame as I was, I cannot tell, but I was so zealous in the work that I did not mind going any distance to attend a prayer meeting. I actually walked           a greater part of the distance fast asleep; I knew the road pretty well. There used to be a great many run-aways in that section, and they would hide away in the woods and swamps, and if they found a person alone as I was, they would spring out at them and rob them. As this thought came into my head during my lonely walk, thinks I, it won't do for me to go to sleep, and I began to look about me for some weapon of defence; I took my jackknife from my pocket and opened it; now I am ready to stab the first one that tackles me, I said; but try as I would, I commenced to nod, nod, till I was fast asleep again. The long walk and the exertion of carrying on the meeting had nearly used me up.             The way in which we worshiped is almost indescribable. The singing was accompanied by a certain ecstasy of motion, clapping of hands, tossing of heads, which would continue without cessation about half an hour; one would lead off in a kind of recitative style, others joining in the chorus. The old house partook of the ecstasy; it rang with their jubilant shouts, and shook in all its joints. It is not to be wondered at that I fell asleep, for when I awoke I found I had lost my knife, and the fact that I would now have to depend on my own muscle, kept me awake till I had reached the neighborhood of my home. There was a lane about half a mile from the house, on each side of which was a ditch to drain the road, and was nearly half full of water; as I neared this lane I fell asleep again, as the first thing I knew I was in the ditch; I had walked right off into it, best clothes and all. Such a paddling to get out you never saw. I was wide           awake enough now you may rest assured, and went into the house sick enough; my feet were all swollen, and I was laid up for two or three clays. My mistress came in to see me, and said I must have medicine. I had to bear it, and she dosed me well.             As soon as I was able, I went to work. I had a shop all to myself. My master lived five miles away, but would come once a week and take all the earnings; some weeks I would make a great deal, then I would keep some back for myself, as I had worked for it. In this way I saved at one time fifteen dollars; I went to the store, bought a piece of cloth, carried it to the tailor and had a suit made--I had already bought a watch, and had a chain and seal. You can imagine how I looked the following Sunday; I was very proud and loved to dress well, and all the young people used to make a great time over me; it was Brother Payne here, and Brother Payne there; in fact, I was nearly everywhere.             The other slaves were obliged to be on the plantation when the horn blew, at daybreak, but sometimes I did not get home till twelve o'clock; sometimes it would be night, and I always escaped a whipping. The first Sunday that I was arrayed in my new suit, I was passing the court house bounds, when I saw my master and a man named Betts standing near by. Betts caught sight of me; says he:  Lindsey, come here.  Not knowing what he wanted, I went to him; whereupon he commenced looking first at me, then at my master; then at my master, then at me; finally he said:  Who is master; Lindsey or you, for he dresses better than you do? Does he own you, or do you own him?        
     which to appear with decency on the occasion of taking his baptismal vows, and received two dollars,--sixteen- fold more than Col. Suttle ever gave him at any one time, before or after.             At the proper time he was baptized and received into the Baptist church at Falmouth. The church consisted of white freemen and black slaves. All assembled within the same walls for worship on the Sabbath, but a partition of boards separated the bond from the free. When the Holy Supper was administered, the cup was first carefully served to all of the privileged class, and afterward to their sable brethren. Those distinctions were not maintained in anticipation of heaven, but in deference to the prejudices of Virginia society. In the social religious meetings there was a somewhat nearer approach to the New Testament model, and the prayers and exhortations of the slaves were graciously suffered to intermingle with those proceeding from the master's lips.             Among the Christian slaves at the south there is a class of persons that bear the character of quasi-pastors or preachers. Without being formally set apart to the sacred office by any rite of ordination, they yet receive a sort of recognition from the church with which they may happen to be connected. Piety, a gift at exhortation, and a desire for the work of a preacher, are the requisite qualifications. All these were found in Anthony when, at the end of two years from the period of his baptism, he applied to his brethren for their recognition           of him as a preacher. A day was appointed when he should exhibit his gifts to the assembled members of the church. Sitting around with ears more than usually critical, yet not without sympathy, they listened while Anthony addressed to them an exhortation from the desk. His effort proved satisfactory, and, at the close, pastor and brethren, taking him by the hand, bade him God speed. Thenceforth he exercised his now office as he had opportunity. Gathering a little congregation of slaves, sometimes in the kitchen of a friendly white person, sometimes in the rude cabin of a slave, he would lead them in their devotions and speak to them of the Gospel. These meetings, however, as well as all other assemblies consisting exclusively of slaves, were violations of Virginia law. Every such assembly, unless sanctioned by the presence of a white, was exposed to rude interruption, and the slaves that might be caught, to severe punishment. The patrols and guards that nightly walked their rounds were constantly on the watch to detect these secret meetings, and, in spite of all caution, they would occasionally succeed. Perhaps while the assembly were in the act of prayer, the door would be suddenly burst open by a throng of profane officials, each with cord in hand, bent on securing as many victims as possible. When such  surprisals  occurred, the first movement would be to extinguish the lights; then, through door, window, and even chimney, the affrighted worshippers hurried their escape. Those who were           unlucky enough to be caught, were taken to the cage,  1      1 A place provided everywhere in towns at the South, for the temporary confinement of delinquent slaves.   and the next day rewarded with nine-and-thirty lashes at the whipping post for having peacefully, but unlawfully, assembled to worship God. Anthony was not without experience of this sort, though he was always so fortunate as to escape from the clutches of the officers.             In his new capacity, it sometimes fell to his lot to perform the marriage rite for slaves, or what among them was called such; and sometimes to conduct the burial service for the dead. If a slave died during the week, no funeral was allowed to interrupt the daily toil of the plantation. The body, encased perchance in an orange-box, was deposited in the ground without ceremony or delay, and a few shovelfulls of earth were thrown in, while the bereaved kindred went about their toil as usual. But on the following Sabbath, the whole body of the slaves, attended by the master or the overseer, assembled to  sod the grave.  With prayers, exhortations, and much singing of hymns, in the sad, wild negro airs, this final ceremony was completed.             In death as in life, the social distinctions of slavery are carefully maintained. Laid to rest in a  potter's field,  the dead bodies of the slaves .never mingle their dust with that of the sovereign race. No monument, inscribed with the name of the deceased, ever marks the spot where he lies, as      
    HISTORY OF REUBEN SMITH.  AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE FROM VIRGINIA.           Reuben was a slave belonging to R. Baylor, of Essex county, State of Virginia. Reuben was a member of the Enon Baptist Church, and acted as deacon amongst the coloured members. He was also regarded as a minister by his coloured brethren. He was a man of a little education, and on that account would sometimes venture to take a text in preaching, though it is positively against the law in that State for any coloured person, free or slave, to make use of a text. However, this point of offence was not noticed in his case. He was successful in his mode of preaching, and God blessed those simple efforts to the conversion of many souls. He frequently visited my father's home in the village of Loretto, where they consulted together as brethren bound to the same great cause of humanity. He often expressed to my father a desire to be free, and spoke of his determination to be free at some period not far distant. He was a blacksmith by trade, and lived some distance from his master's dwelling. This gave him an opportunity of       calling on my father oftener. In the month of May, in the year 1845, Reuben made up his mind to leave for the North, having obtained some person's free papers, as a protection against any arrest. He crossed the Rappahannock River, then the Potomac, and made his way to the capital of the United States, the great city of Washington. On arriving there he was suspected, and in spite of every exertion to save himself. His papers being examined were declared false, because his height and colour did not agree with the description. The papers issued by the courts of the States are very particular in their description. The poor fellow was taken to prison. By this time notice had arrived at Washington, speaking of the escape of such a person from one Richard Baylor, in the county of Essex, and offering a large reward for the slave's apprehension. His master soon received intelligence of the arrest made in Washington, and immediately sent his overseer for Reuben. Reuben was then taken to the slave pen in the city of Richmond, where he was kept for some months training for the auction block. He was finally sold to a slave dealer in the State of Louisiana. Such was the fate of poor Reuben. May God smile upon him in his sufferings! The body is enslaved, but the soul of Reuben can never be chained. I have often thought of him, and prayed that the God of all peace may yet open a way for his escape.           The church to which Reuben and myself belonged now    
   Gorgonia, I told the purser that I was going to California, and I wanted him to pay me my money for my labor. I said to him,  Do you see anything green in my eye?  But, however, I concluded that I was even, so I picked up a pillow-case, and put half a ham in it and two loaves of bread, and started over the side of the ship with it into a boat, and went on shore. After I got ashore I met a Californian, and he asked me where I was going and where I came from. I told him that I came from the United States, and that I was going to California, if I could get there, and that I had run away from the ship and had no money of any account. He put his hand into his pocket, gave me a ten-dollar gold piece, and told me  to keep out of the whisky shops and dance houses, and you will do well in that country.            Now this was a white man, and there were seven colored men aboard the ship, and some of them had plenty of money, but none of them did anything towards helping me along at all. When I got up Chagres river, my money was gone: I had no place to sleep, and no money to pay for a sleeping place. I then went down on board of the boat, turned my coat-collar up and my hat down over my eyes. The next morning one of the passengers saw me and he said,  Have those colored boys done anything for you, or have they helped you any yet?  I said,  No, sir.   Well, why don't you go and ask them?  I said,  They know I have no money or anything, and as they do not give me anything, or ask how I am doing, I am not going to ask them.  I knew some of them had either read or heard the following words:  Whosoever hath this world's goods and meets his brother in need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?  He gave me a dollar, and told me to go in and get my breakfast. I went in and got my breakfast, and started for Panama about four o'clock in the afternoon, leaving the mules and two horses out all night.            I  went to the American Hotel, and I asked the landlord if I could stop there. He said,  Yes,  and the first man that got there from the boat was the man that gave me the dollar on board the boat to get my breakfast. His name was Mr. Agner. He said to me,  Clean my pants, and bring me some water to wash my feet, and I will see that your bill is paid here.  He then went to the landlord and said,  Give        this man whatever he wants to eat and drink, and I will pay it.  Then the landlord turned to me and said,  I will give you seventy-five dollars a month if you will act as porter for me.  I assured him that I would do so. The colored men I left behind, who came on the ship the same time, I met at the door. I said to them,  Give me your names, gentlemen; also your baggage.  Say they,  Get out; where is the landlord?   Give me your baggage, and just walk into the sitting-room.  But they still refused to do so. I then called the attention of the landlord, who said,  Give your baggage to this man, for he is the porter, and he is the proper representative to take care of it;  which of course made me walk as though I owned all the house. You remember just the night before I had nowhere to lay my head; and being raised from that situation to the porterage of one of the finest hotels in Panama, it was a large jump. Reader, do you not think I should have been grateful for such a great beneficent benefactor? How I should strive to render due gratitude unto Him: I should say with the poet--                At supper time I rang the bell, and they all came down to supper, the passengers looking upon me with much astonishment. One of them, of dark hue, who had not treated me with the respect he ought to have done, said,  Hallo, Williams, how is it that you have got to be porter here?  This was done to blandish me. I then thought it was my time to treat him with the same contempt that he had treated me with on the boat. This you know was wrong; it was not doing as my Bible taught me. I once heard of a little girl who read her Bible, and gave proof that she was governed by its precepts. The facts were these: she had been to school; on her way home she met with a little girl who always made it a point to push her out of the path. This day it pleased her teacher to give Emma, for that was her name, a great many bunches of grapes, and on her way home, as usual, she came in contact with the other little girl, and she gave this same little girl some of them. Going home        she told her mother concerning the grapes, and she said to her,  I think your teacher was very kind to give you so many.  She told her mother that that was not all she could tell her; for she had given some to a little girl who always pushed her out of the path.           I said to the man,  That is my business, sir, and not for you to know.  They staid in the house, about six days; then they got a chance to take the old steamship Republic. Henry Smith went on board as steward; one man of dark complexion amongst the crowd said,  I will speak to Mr. Smith to get you a situation on board.  I said,  Thank you, sir.  Mr. Smith came to me, falling back on his dignity, after he had been accosted about me. Speaking to me in a very high tone of voice and with authority, he said,  Mr. So-and-So,  calling the gentleman by name,  has been talking to me about your wanting to go to California. Says he,  The rest of the boys have all been employed, but if you want to go I will give you a billet, though the boys have been given wages, if you will work your passage.  I paused a few moments; seeing there were hundreds of people here wanting to go and could not get a passage to California from this place, I soon reflected and accepted the billet, having an idea that I could do so much better if I could reach California. After I had started and went on board of the ship with him and had been set to work, I remembered that I had a lot of Mr. Agner's clothes at the washerwoman's, and he knew not where they were, and he had been so good to me, so I started to go ashore to take the clothes to him. I spoke to the second steward, and he gave me permission to go and do so. While on shore I met the head steward, Mr. Smith. He cursed me because I came ashore, and said I had no right there; it made no matter who gave me permission unless it came from him. He said,  You shall not go in the ship, so you may stay here.  A few of the passengers gathered around and heard him talking to me, and were going to club him. I went back and told Mr. Agner what had happened, and he said,  Never mind; it is all right. I will pay your passage out to California in the Jenny Lind.  He paused for a few moments, after which he wrote a note to Capt. Hudson. The captain looked at the note, and then said,  I thought you went aboard in the steward's boat last night?   I did, sir,      
   Now the poor slave when he is tied to the whipping post and whipped almost to death, he has no father to protect him, and no mother to protect him, and no one to fly to but his Heavenly Father. They have to bear patiently with their hard task masters, and live humble and faithful to God, and then at the end of the warfare God will richly crown them in heaven.           When I was travelling in Foxboro, I fell in among Universalists, and they entertained the way-faring and degraded Aaron very hospitably, and treated me like a brother, minister and all. They wrote considerable for Aaron towards printing in my book, and  throwed  in and helped me to some money towards getting it printed. I staid seven days with them. And I bid 'em good bye, and wished the blessing of God upon 'em. Aaron says he wonders there arn't a thousand Universalists to where there is one. He wonders there arn't a thousand infidels in the world to where there is one, because the white brethren believe in the true light and gospel, and sentiments of the Holy Ghost, and yet set a bad example for their white brethren to stumble over. That is what makes me say it is a wonder there is not a thousand infidels and Universalists to where there is one. Men, again, who live up to the moral law, wont enslave their brethren. Aaron says that no true hearted Christian will begin to hold his brother in bonds. The bible says, he that stealeth a man and selleth him, shall surely be put to death. If he is found in his hands, that thief shall die. If a man hateth his brother whom he has already seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen. God says, in the eyes of man, there is respect to persons, but in his eyes, there is no respect to persons. Whenever a man is cleansed from his sin and iniquity, he is a new formed creature in Christ Jesus. Christ is in that white friend the hope of glory, and he is in Christ, and so therefore there is no respect to persons. He will treat an African brother as well as a white brother. He will not oppress him. If he is a wolf clothed in sheep's clothing, he will stand up and say, it is right to enslave the African brother.--But if he is a sincere, godly man, he will not stand up and say it is right.           When Aaron was in the middle of the town in Wrentham, I fell among several anti-slavery families, and they treated me very coldly, much as ever I could do to get a place to sleep, but the Lord opened the heart of a white brother who had not been living in the place more than six months, who gave me a first rate bed to sleep in, and first rate food to eat. The next morning was a very pleasant one, and I told him if I never saw him no more, that I might have grace to meet him in heaven, and bid him and his family good by.           I fell in with a young minister. * * * * His wife was a short woman of dark hair, and she made out to write Aaron part of a chapter. His wife entertained Aaron very hospitably, she asked me if I would not have something to eat, and I thanked     
   and, after a conference, Schenk called Quamino into the parlor, and queried whether he would like to see his father and mother, his master and mistress, his young masters and mistresses,  c. On his giving an affirmative reply, he was told:-- Well, your master has sent for you, and this man has come to take you.  Overcome with this too sudden announcement, he burst into a violent and uncontrollable fit of crying, and for hours cried aloud as though he had been beaten--unable to answer questions, or to stay his emotions at the kindest efforts to pacify him.  Oh,  said his master,  the shock was too much for him.  And he continued to sob the remainder of the day, whilst endeavouring to perform his work. As he related it, in his venerable age, to the writer, he was asked whether it was joy that affected him. He replied,  It seems so, sir--I don't know, and  I didn't know then --it struck me to the heart.            On his return to Jersey, his young associates were so grown beyond his knowledge, that he felt like a stranger in his childish haunts.           When nearing the age of manhood, he was steady in his attendance upon religious meetings, walking several miles through all kinds of weather. His own account of the motive for going was, that he  liked to have the name of being a good boy.  One Sabbath evening, returning home from meeting, he had impressions of a striking character; his imagination being evidently much acted upon.        As he trod the familiar way, a new road appeared to branch off to the right hand, leading up the mountain. Intent on pursuing it, he hastened to look into it, and saw distinctly  a dry, smooth path,  leading upward as far as he could see; but, as  he was about to enter it, (to quote the old man's own words,)  I heard a noise like half-a-dozen horses, coming after me, rattling as hard as they could lay their legs on the ground.  He turned his head, and the illusion was broken. The old man's tears trickled, as he said,  and there, sir, I lost it! I thought,  said he,  that it was a token for something or other.  On reaching home, the family were in bed, and he went to the barn, where, after earnest exercise in prayer, he slept upon the straw. Very early in the morning, he went into the field to work, first kneeling by the fence. Being in much distress, the gracious words of the Saviour were distinctly revived to him,  LET NOT YOUR HEART BE TROUBLED. YE BELIEVE IN GOD, BELIEVE ALSO IN ME.  And, yielding his whole heart, and all his powers, to him who was calling for the sacrifice, he was made sensible of the reception of the  unspeakable gift.  He went to his work;  and oh,  said he,  everything was glorious around me--everything seemed  engaged  praising God!            The change which had come over the youth was conspicuous to all who knew him. He was diligent in attention to all his duties, but he had no inclination     
0      and the reason many were deceived was because they was not honest to themselves.            I think God has begun a good work in this part of his heritage, in which he has and continues to sow the seed of his kingdom; and while I am aware there is much that falls on the stony ground, I feel encouraged in the belief that there has some fallen on good ground, and I often pray God to prosper it, that it may bring forth fruit to his praise, and that the stony heart of man may be subdued. The Lord has lately been showing a small field of labor, which I believe it is his will that I should enter into, although the time it is to be accomplished, and the manner in which it is to be brought about, is yet hid from me; although, not long since, there came a delegation from the very place, inviting me to go and see them on a gospel mission. I told them that a mere call from man was not sufficient to set off on such a work; and I also told them that if the Lord had put it in their hearts to call me to their neighborhood, he would probably renew it, when one of them, a very humble-hearted Christian, said that he felt before leaving  home that it was the will of God. I then informed  them how I had felt about it, and I further told them that forty odd years had now passed away since the Lord first call me to this work; and when I excuse myself, saying,  I, poor slave,  and so on, he promise he help whenever I need him, and his promises are yea and amen forever; and at that time I did not know A from B, and I know but very little now, except what the Lord teach me, neither do I desire to, for God has said he will teach his people hisself, so that if a man lack wisdom he should ask it of God, and not of man, whose breath is in his nostrils,            very humble people at that time,) when I was awakened to a sense of my condition from these words, dropped from a humble minister:  The wicked have no hope beyond the grave, while the righteous have a hope beyond Jordan's cold stream; and after they have crossed Jordan they have gone home to a God of pity, to a God of compassion, to a God of sovereign mercy.  These words took a deep hold on my wicked heart, and break up the great deep in my soul. And this prepare me to seek such a friend. And after searching a long season of time, the Friend of Sinners appear and fill my heart with love. He give me peace of soul and confidence of mind; then I could gladly tell this glorious Savior's mine. This  destroyed all earthly fear, and prepare me to rest in hope. And  then I could say, by sea or land, by day or night:  The Lord is ever mine!  Forty odd years I travel on in this way, and it now appears more precious than the first. And now I say:                 Now, I would be glad for all the world to know that after I was awakened, as I have described, that love, in place of fear, fill my heart. May be I better say here that very often, when I goin' on in wickedness, something tell me this wicked, and I feel very bad. At that time I did not know that it was that good Spirit talking with me; yet I know all the time that I was doing wrong, 'cause I feel guilty, and that make me afraid. But when I give all up to serve the Lord, He promise He help whenever I need Him. And soon     
    CHAPTER II.     MY EARLY STUDIES OF RELIGION AND LEARNING--OPPOSITION, ETC.              When I was a small boy I desired two things; one was to be a good Christian, and the other was to learn my book well. I often stole away in private or secret to pray. I often stole away to prayer meetings and preachings. Early, as in good ground, was the precious seed of grace sown in my heart; but like many others, hard trials, whippings, slavery and bad company drew off considerable from these precious feelings; yet, I thank God that I retained them and thought on them, for they hardly left me night or day, until I arrived in the State of Indiana; there I shortly after made a profession of the love of God being shed abroad in my heart, and joined the church. I think we as a race ought to try and get to Heaven, where there is no slavery, or whipping, or selling for gold. O, that God would keep me faithful till death.           When I got to Mississippi, where they work, curse, swear and dance on Sunday, I felt awfully; no preaching or Bible to read, or anything to give consolation, but the whip and hard work; no one called on God for a blessing, but a curse. But I think God it was no worse with me than it was, for many fared worse than I did.           In getting the learning I obtained, I had to buy my book and keep it very secretly. Though very young, say about eight or nine years old, I often carried my book in my hat or        pocket, for fear of detection, and hid it in the leaves or earth for fear of the lash or detection, for it was against all the laws of Virginia for slaves or blacks to be taught to read or write; but by hard study and labor, and much secrecy, and the assistance of some little white boys and girls, I managed to gain some information. While the slave boys would be playing marbles, my attention would be on my book; often, when I would be looking on my book, the approach or sight of a white man made me put it aside. In this situation, how I have mourned for a little instruction.           Finally, after Providence had smiled on me, and I could read a little, I then desired to learn to write. My copies were old scraps of writing that I could pick up at times. Then, after my day's work was over, by fire-light I would practice upon my lessons in writing. In passing on during the day, when I had an opportunity I would stoop down and practice a little in thousand, but when the old slaveholder saw it, he would tell me that I was studying philosophy, and that he would whip it out of me, etc., etc.           Thus, I thank God, I made such advancement that I could read and write considerable. There being many in my condition who wanted to learn very badly, they persuaded me to teach them a little on Sundays; so we went on teaching and learning a few Sundays before the white people found it out, and gave us our orders never to meet for instructions any more, on the peril of the lash; and our little school was broken up forever.           Then I was watched closely the balance of the time I staid in Virginia, so the reader may account for my imperfections in my simple narrative and tale. But here, Christian reader, my heart runs out in thanks to God for his great blessings toward me, who, I must acknowledge, as David said,  The Lord is my  sheperd,  I shall not want; surely goodness and        mercy have followed me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.  Yes, reader, I can look back and see the goodness of God in all the train of my distress, and if they are faithful, I think many poor slaves will get to Heaven, where there is no slavery, or whipping, or selling Christian slaves for gold.           I have often thought it would be a good and great thing if all the slaves and free persons would unite and pray for deliverance; I believe God would graciously deliver them out of their Southern bondage; I believe the time would shortly come when God would aid them from Heaven. O, when God works, moves, and thunders, and shakes the earth, man trembles, shakes, quakes and fears. As the poet says:      God moves in a mysterious way,                 Deep and unfathomable is the power and wisdom of God. O, that we all would trust the Lord for his goodness, which endureth forever.        
      bidder, to be transported to a distant part of the country, leaving the dearest relatives behind; to be, in fine, ground down mentally and physically by the untold curses of slavery, may be a very pretty thing to the masters of the  peculiar institution,  but it is death to the slaves.             After more than twenty years of bondage, God delivered me from it, with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, as he did Israel of old.             As near as I can remember, my mother and sister were sold and taken to New Orleans, leaving four brothers and myself behind. We were all placed out. At six years of age I was placed with a Mr. Bradford, separated from my father, mother and family. But the eye of God was upon me, and blessed me. My master was a carpenter, and much from home--Mrs. Bradford beat me so much that her husband sent me to his father's. Mrs. Bradford ordered me one day to take a bushel of corn up stairs; but

    the medical profession. Nevertheless, the son often said that he believed God had destined him for the sacred calling, and devoted much of his time in exhorting his neighbors to seek repentance.            Most planters in our section cared but little about the religious training of their slaves, regarding them as they did their cattle,--an investment, the return of which was only to be considered in dollars and cents. Not so, however, with Dr. John Gaines, for he took special pride in looking after the spiritual welfare of his slaves, having them all in the  great house,  at family worship, night and morning.            On Sabbath mornings, reading of the Scriptures, and explaining the same, generally occupied from one to two hours, and often till half of the negroes present were fast asleep. The white members of the family did not take as kindly to the religious teaching of the doctor, as did the blacks.            For his Christian zeal, I had the greatest respect, for I always regarded him as a truly pious and conscientious man, willing at all times to give of his means the needful in spreading the Gospel.            Mrs. Sarah Gaines was a lady of considerable merit, well-educated, and of undoubted piety. If she did not join heartily in her husband's religious enthusiasm, it was not for want of deep and genuine Christian feeling, but from the idea that he was of more humble origin than herself, and, therefore, was not a capable instructor.            This difference in birth, this difference in antecedents does much in the South to disturb family relations     
   fact and said he was going to have Tom Black whip me the next day, which was Saturday; in fact he told him in my presence to do it on Monday morning. But previous to this he called me up to know why I disobeyed his order. I told him that I was not hired for that purpose. Oh, but how he did cut up, yet he did not attempt to strike me.           Before going home to my master, which I certainly should have done, I thought it best to use a little strategy. During Sunday I had a talk with Mr. Black in which I told him my plans. He advised me not to go, and said that unless ordered again he would not attempt to whip me, and even then he would give me plenty of chance to run; but he said he would go and see Mr. Beasley that day. Now what passed between them I am unable to state, but when Mr. Black returned he said it was all right, and it was, for I was never molested after that, and Mr. Beasley revoked the order and had two men detailed to saw wood about four o'clock every evening. I had no more trouble that year with Beasley or his overseer.           I enjoyed life in the factories very much. We had good wholesome food and plenty of it, and when the factory closed at sunset we were free to go where we pleased until sunrise next day. I remember that the M. E. Church, South, allowed the colored people to meet in the basement of their church, and their minister preached to them every Sunday, commencing at three o'clock, P. M., and his text was not always from Luke xii. 47, or Titus ii. 9, but I have no recollection of hearing one preached from Ephesians vi. 9, where the duties of master to servant are explained. Some of the ministers were good men and preached reasonable sermons        giving good advice, spiritually and morally, and were beloved by their colored congregations. I remember one whose name was W. G. Cooper, who was so well admired by his colored flock that they raised forty-five dollars and presented him a suit of clothes, when he went to conference, and sent a petition to have him returned to that charge.           Nearly every slave made some money which he could spend for fine clothes or such other things suited to his taste, so that when attending church I remember that the slaves were dressed almost as nicely as their owners, at any rate they looked as well as I have seen them on like occasions since they have been free.           We had some colored preachers, too, who held prayer meetings in their quarters and preached every Sunday afternoon in the white people's church, but there was always some leading white man present to take note of what the preacher said. If he used words deemed insubordinate or not in keeping with the pro-slavery idea, he was promptly stopped, there and then, and lectured for his mistake, and in some cases his license was recalled. Of course these licenses were granted by his master to preach during good behavior. Not three in ten of these preachers could read their texts or any other part of the Bible, but they stood in the pulpit, opened the Bible, gave out the song which did not always fit the tune, and delivered prayer with much force and in language that, while not the choicest, greatly impressed its hearers.           There were a few colored men who could read the Bible, in and around Brunswick at that time, but none of them were preachers. The men who felt themselves called to preach had no education at all, but had a fair     
              For nine months I was unable to walk a step. I was obliged to crawl upon my hands and knees for anything I desired. I suffered the most excruciating pain that can be imagined by mortal man.             I had no rest night or day; I was nearly driven to insanity. I often wondered why God suffered such things to be, that I should suffer so terribly from wicked, unprincipled and unjust men. As soon as I could walk I was again sold, at the age of fifteen, to Mr. James Davis, who was not quite so cruel a man as my old master. For three years I had to labor hard ploughing and hoeing in the field, with no flesh on the bones in the centre of my legs, and when the clothes were removed from my legs, the white bones could be plainly seen; it was a ghastly sight and makes my blood run cold as I relate it.             Often while at my work I would strike my legs against the plough handles, filling my shoes with blood, and it was in this painful state that I was obliged to continue ploughing. Many times I was called to my master, stripped and terribly beaten, my flesh was cut all to pieces, the blood would run down my back like water, and to this day I could not tell why I was so fearfully and cruelly beaten.             I was sold again to Mr. Richardson; he was almost an angel compared to my other masters; and it was about this time that I lost sight of my mother, and to this day my eyes have not rested upon her. I know not whether she is living or dead; my sister was sold at the same time, and thus the whole family were separated, and if we never meet again in this world we shall meet after the storms of life are over, in that beautiful home on high, to part no more forever.             I staid with Mr. Richardson until I was twenty-eight years of age; he treated me quite well. Notwithstanding his good treatment I froze my feet twice, the skin peeling off, and I could not walk for a number of months; he was very kind to me in the midst of my afflictions, and learned me to knit stockings. It was about this time, when I was all alone in the world, when I had no kind and loving mother to teach me lessons of truth, purity, and wisdom, no sympathetic father to take me by the hand and guide me in the right path, no loving sister to embrace me, and speak words of comfort and cheer.             But while fastened with the chains of slavery, like Daniel in the lion's den, while suffering terrible afflictions, greater than Job,           bowed down with sorrow and grief, while tortured in mind, body and soul, that I resolved to seek aid from God on high, that he might save my soul from torment, and I came to Christ and asked him in mercy to take my feet from the miry clay and plant them upon the rock of eternal ages; and to this day I am looking up to him as my only hope and support while battling with the stern realities of life.             I recall to mind, right here, a terrible scene that I witnessed on a plantation belonging to Mr. Bris, who owned about nine hundred slaves. At this time the slaves did not know how to run away; they would run to the woods, remain there and then come back. One day three men ran away from the plantation and remained a number of months; when they came back he ordered them to be tied up to the whipping post. He used the lash himself; he lashed them until he no longer had strength to do it, then he ordered them taken down and sent to the next overseer, and ordered them to be again whipped, and for the second time they were beaten, and after he had whipped them as long as could, they were taken down and sent to another overseer. He refused to whip them and ordered them back again to their master, but they tried to escape. The master chased them on horseback, one gave himself up, the other two still running, the slave owner said he would have them, but sooner than be taken, they ran and jumped into a red hot furnace and put an end to their lives.             I call to mind another sad and terrible scene which took place in Frederick City, Md. The slave owners bought up all the slaves they could, fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, friends, babes and gray haired old men, had them all brought to the jail and handcuffed together with an iron collar around their necks, with iron bolts riveted to the collars, then fastened to the chains on the handcuffs, then in this condition they were obliged to walk one hundred and fifty miles to the vessel where they were shipped to South Carolina, to be sold and suffer the pangs of slavery.             It was while witnessing such cold blooded scenes as this that caused me to cry out in the agony of my heart,--hear me, O ye heavens, bear witness ye murmuring streams, hear me ye hosts of heaven, bear witness thou inspirer of eternal truth, thou maker and upholder of all things, that America has sealed her doom. This guilty nation must fall; God will utterly forsake the American Union in its guilt; he has heard the wails of millions who have gone      
              Having always, from parental training, purposed in my mind to become religious before I died, I thought that now was the time to begin to pray. But I could not try to pray in the church, for I was afraid that the girls would laugh at me. Yet I became so troubled, that I left the house, girls and all, intending to seek some place where I might pray. But to my horror and surprise, when I got out of the church, this reflection occurred to me,  God is in heaven, and you are on earth:--how can He hear you?  O, what distress of mind I now felt! I began to wonder how God could hear my prayer;. for, sure enough, He was in heaven, and I on the earth. In my perplexity, I started for home.             Just before I reached the shop, where I slept, this thought struck me, if possible with more force than the former reflection:  God does see you!  It really appeared to me as if I could see that God was indeed looking at me; and not only so, but I felt that He had been looking at me all my life. I now said to myself,  It is of no use for me to pray.-- If God has seen all my wickedness, as I feel that He has, then there is no mercy for me.              So I ran to my lodging-place, and tried to          hide myself in a dark room. But this was useless; for it appeared that God could see me in the dark, as well as in the light.             I now felt constrained to beg for mercy, and spent the time in trying to obtain pardon for my sins. But the morning came, and the hour drew near for the hands to go to work, and I was still unhappy.             I felt so very different to what I had always felt, that I tried to examine my impressions of the previous night, to learn if it was true that God did see me or not; for I thought my imagination might have deceived me.             Up to this time, I was not fully convinced that God knew all about me. So I began to study about the matter. As I sat on the shoe-bench, I picked up a bunch of bristles, and selecting one of the smallest, I began to wonder, if God could see an object so small as that. No sooner had this inquiry arose in my heart, than it appeared to me, that the Lord could not only see the bristle, but that He beheld me, as, plainly as I saw the little object in my hand; and not only so, but that God was then looking through me, just as I would hold up a tumbler of clear water to the sun and look through it. This was enough.          I felt that I must pray, or perish; and now I began to pray.             But it really seemed, that the more I prayed the less hope there was for me. Still I could not stop praying; for I felt that God was angry with me. I had sinned against his holy laws; and now, if He should cut me off, and send me to hell, it was but right. These thoughts followed me day and night, for five weeks, before I felt relief. At length, one day, while sitting on my shoe bench, I felt that my time had come when I must die. What troubled me most, was that I should have to appear before God, in all my sins;--O, what horror filled my soul at the thought!             I began to wonder what I must do. I knew I was not prepared for death and the Judgment. It is true that two of my shopmates, at that time, were members of the church; but they did not seem to care for my soul. All the rest of the hands were as wicked as myself.  What shall I do?  was in my mind, all the time I sat at work.             The reflection occurred to me,  Your mother is a christian; it may be she can save you.  But this suggestion appeared to be offensive to God. Then came another thought,-- As          my master was a rich man, could he not do something to help me?  But I found no relief in either . . . . and while I sat thus, hoping and praying, light broke into my mind--all my trouble left me in an instant.             I felt such a love and peace flowing in my soul, that I could not sit longer; I sprang to my feet, and cried out,  Glory to God!  It seemed to me, that God, whom I had beheld, a few seconds previously, angry with me, was now well-pleased. I could not tell why this great change had taken place in me; and my shopmates were surprised at my conduct, saying, that I must be getting crazy. But, just at this moment, the thought came into my mind, that I was converted; still, as I felt so very different from what I had expected to feel, I could not see how that could be. I concluded to run and see my mother, and ask her how people felt, when they got converted. So I went, right away, to my mother's house, some five or six squares from the shop.             When I reached the door of her house, it appeared to me that everything was new and bright. I went in, and sat down. Mother asked me how I was. I told her, I felt  right smart.  This was a new sound from me; for          my answers to this question had long been--   poorly.   But now came the trial; to ask mother how people felt, when they were converted. I felt ashamed to ask the question; so I went into another room; and seeing a hymn book lying on the table, I took it up. The first hymn that struck my sight began with these words:      When converts first begin to sing,        c.           These lines expressed my feelings precisely, and being encouraged from them, I went to my mother, and asked her the question--  How do people feel, when they get converted?  She replied,  Do you think you are converted?  Now, this was a severe trial; for, although I felt that I was really changed, yet I wanted to hear from her, before I could decide whether I was actually converted, or not. I replied,  No.  Then she said,  My son, the devil makes people think themselves converted, sometimes.  I arose, and          left immediately, believing that the devil had made a fool of me. I returned to my shop, more determined to pray than ever before.             I arrived, and took my seat, and tried to get under that same weight, that I had felt pressing me down, but a short while before. But it seemed to me that I could not; and, instead of feeling sad, I felt joyful in my heart; and while trying to pray, I thought the Saviour appeared to me. I thought I saw God smiling upon me, through Christ, His Son. My soul was filled with love to God and Jesus Christ. It appeared to me, I saw a fullness in Jesus Christ, to save every sinner who would come to Him. And I felt, that if I was only converted, I would tell all sinners how precious the Saviour was. But I could not think myself converted yet, because I could not see what I had done, for God to pardon my sins. Still I felt a love to Him for what He had done for my soul.             Then I began to think upon my shopmates --and, O what pity ran through my soul for them. I wished to pray for them; but I felt so unworthy, that I could not do it. At last I promised the Lord that if He would convert my soul, I would talk to them.                   * * It was several months after that, before I was made to realize this to be the work of God; and when it was made plain, O what joy it did bring to my poor soul!             I shortly became a member of the Baptist church, and was baptized, in company with some twenty others, by Rev. Geo. F. Adams, who was then pastor of the Baptist church in Fredericksburg--September 19,1831. This then contained about three hundred colored members.       
      impart to him so much of the mystery as I had been able to penetrate. Thus the light of this grand movement broke in upon my mind by degrees; and I must say that ignorant as I was of the philosophy of that movement, I believed in it from the first, and I believed in it, partly, because I saw that it alarmed the consciences of the slaveholders. The insurrection  of Nat. Turner had been quelled, but the alarm and terror  which it occasioned had not subsided. The cholera was then on its way to this country, and I remember thinking that God was angry with the white people because of their  slaveholding wickedness, and therefore his judgments were abroad in the land. Of course it was impossible for me not to hope much for the abolition movement when I saw it supported by the Almighty, and armed with DEATH.             Previously to my contemplation of the anti-slavery movement  and its probable results, my mind had been seriously awakened to the subject of religion. I was not more than thirteen years old, when in my loneliness and destitution I longed for some one to whom I could go, as to a father and protector. The preaching of a white Methodist minister, named Hanson, was the means of causing me to feel that in God I had such a friend. He thought that all men, great and small, bond and free, were sinners in the sight of God: that they were by nature rebels against his government; and that they must repent of their sins, and be reconciled to God through Christ. I cannot say that I had a very distinct notion of what was required of me, but one thing I did know well: I was wretched and had no means of making myself otherwise. I consulted a good colored man named Charles Lawson,  and in tones of holy affection he told me to pray, and to  cast all my care upon God.  This I sought to do; and though for weeks I was a poor, broken-hearted mourner,  traveling through doubts and fears, I finally found my burden lightened, and my heart relieved. I loved all mankind, slaveholders  not excepted, though I abhorred slavery more than ever. I saw the world in a new light, and my great concern           was to have everybody converted. My desire to learn increased,  and especially, did I want a thorough acquaintance with the contents of the Bible. I have gathered scattered pages of the Bible from the filthy street-gutters, and washed and dried them, that in moments of leisure I might get a word or two of wisdom from them. While thus religiously seeking knowledge, I became acquainted with a good old  colored man named Lawson. This man not only prayed three times a day, but he prayed as he walked through the streets, at his work, on his dray--everywhere. His life was a life of prayer, and his words when he spoke to any one, were about a better world. Uncle Lawson lived near Master Hugh's house, and becoming deeply attached to him, I went often with him to prayer-meeting, and spent much of my leisure time with him on Sunday. The old man could read a little, and I was a great help to him in making out the hard words, for I was a better reader than he. I could teach him  the letter,  but he could teach me  the spirit,  and refreshing times we had together, in singing and praying. These meetings went on for a long time without the knowledge of Master Hugh or my mistress. Both knew, however, that I had become religious, and seemed to respect my conscientious piety. My mistress was still a professor of religion, and belonged to class. Her leader was no less a person than Rev. Beverly Waugh, the presiding elder, and afterwards one of the bishops of the Methodist Episcopal church.             In view of the cares and anxieties incident to the life she was leading, and especially in view of the separation from religious associations to which she was subjected, my mistress had, as I have before stated, become lukewarm, and needed to be looked up by her leader. This often brought Mr. Waugh to our house, and gave me an opportunity to hear him exhort and pray. But my chief instructor in religious matters was Uncle Lawson. He was my spiritual father and I loved him intensely, and was at his house every chance I could get. This pleasure, however, was not long unquestioned. Master           Hugh became averse to our intimacy, and threatened to whip me if I ever went there again. I now felt myself persecuted by a wicked man, and I  would  go. The good old man had told me that the  Lord had a great work for me to do,  and I must prepare to do it; that he had been shown that I must preach the gospel. His words made a very deep impression upon me, and I verily felt that some such work was before me, though I could not see how I could ever engage in its performance.  The good Lord would bring it to pass in his own good time,  he said, and that I must go on reading and studying the scriptures. This advice and these suggestions were not without their influence on my character and destiny. He fanned my already intense love of knowledge into a flame by assuring me that I was to be a useful man in the world. When I would say to him,  How can these things be? and what can I do?  his simple reply, was,   Trust in the Lord .  When I would tell him,  I am a slave, and a slave for life, how can I do anything?  he would quietly answer,  The  Lord  can make you free, my dear; all things are possible with Him; only have  faith  in God.'Ask, and it shall be given you.' If you want liberty, ask the Lord for it  in  FAITH,  and he will give it to you .              Thus assured and thus cheered on under the inspiration of hope, I worked and prayed with a light heart, believing that my life was under the guidance of a wisdom higher than my own. With all other blessings sought at the mercy seat, I always prayed that God would, of his great mercy and in his own good time, deliver me from my bondage.             I went, one day, on the wharf of Mr. Waters, and seeing two Irishmen unloading a scow of stone or ballast, I went on board unasked, and helped them. When we had finished the work one of the men came to me, aside, and asked me a number of questions, and among them if I were a slave? I told him  I was a slave for life.  The good Irishman gave a shrug, and seemed deeply affected. He said it was a pity so fine a little fellow as I was should be a slave for life. They both had much to say about the matter, and expressed the     
    that I was not alone in abhorring the cruelty and brutality of slavery. A still deeper train of thought was stirred. I saw that there was fear as well as rage in the manner of speaking of the abolitionists, and from this I inferred that they must have some power in the country, and I felt that they might perhaps succeed in their designs. When I met with a slave to whom I deemed it safe to talk on the subject, I would impart to him so much of the mystery as I had been able to penetrate. Thus the light of this grand movement broke in upon my mind by degrees; and I must say that ignorant as I was of the philosophy of that movement, I believed in it from the first, and I believed in it, partly, because I saw that it alarmed the consciences of the slaveholders. The insurrection of Nat. Turner had been quelled, but the alarm and terror which it occasioned had not subsided. The cholera was then on its way to this country, and I remember thinking that God was angry with the white people because of their slaveholding wickedness, and therefore his judgments were abroad in the land. Of course it was impossible for me not to hope much for the abolition movement when I saw it supported by the Almighty, and armed with DEATH.            Previously to my contemplation of the anti-slavery movement and its probable results, my mind had been seriously awakened to the subject of religion. I was not more than thirteen years old, when, in my loneliness and destitution, I longed for some one to whom I could go, as to a father and protector. The preaching of a white Methodist minister, named Hanson, was the means of causing me to feel that in God I had such a friend. He thought that all men, great and small, bond and free, were sinners in the sight of God: that they were by nature rebels against his government: and that they must repent of their sins, and be reconciled to God through Christ. I          cannot say that I had a very distinct notion of what was required of me, but one thing I did know well: that I was wretched and had no means of making myself otherwise. I consulted a good colored man named Charles Lawson, and in tones of holy affection he told me to pray, and to  cast all my care upon God.  This I sought to do; and though for weeks I was a poor, broken-hearted mourner, traveling through doubts and fears, I finally found my burden lightened, and my heart relieved. I loved all mankind, slaveholders not excepted, though I abhorred slavery more than ever. I saw the world in a new light, and my great concern was to have everybody converted. My desire to learn increased, and especially did I want a thorough acquaintance with the contents of the Bible. I have gathered scattered pages of the Bible from the filthy street-gutters, and washed and dried them, that in moments of leisure I might get a word or two of wisdom from them. While thus religiously seeking knowledge, I became acquainted with a good old colored man named Lawson. This man not only prayed three times a day, but he prayed as he walked through the streets, at his work, on his dray--everywhere. His life was a life of prayer, and his words when he spoke to any one, were about a better world. Uncle Lawson lived near Master Hugh's house, and becoming deeply attached to him, I went often with him to prayer-meeting and spent much of my leisure time on Sunday with him. The old man could read a little, and I was a great help to him in making out the hard words, for I was a better reader than he. I could teach him  the letter,  but he could teach me  the spirit,  and refreshing times we had together, in singing and praying. These meetings went on for a long time without the knowledge either of Master Hugh or my mistress. Both knew, however, that I had become religious, and seemed to respect my conscientious piety. My mistress was still a         professor of religion, and belonged to class. Her leader was no less a person than Rev. Beverly Waugh, the presiding elder, and afterwards one of the bishops of the Methodist Episcopal church.            In view of the cares and anxieties incident to the life she was leading, and especially in view of the separation from religious associations to which she was subjected, my mistress had, as I have before stated, become lukewarm, and needed to be looked up by her leader. This often brought Mr. Waugh to our house, and gave me an opportunity to hear him exhort and pray. But my chief instructor in religious matters was Uncle Lawson. He was my spiritual father and I loved him intensely, and was at his house every chance I could get. This pleasure, however, was not long unquestioned. Master Hugh became averse to our intimacy, and threatened to whip me if I ever went there again. I now felt myself persecuted by a wicked man, and I  would  go. The good old man had told me that the  Lord had great work for me to do,  and I must prepare to do it; that he had been shown that I must preach the gospel. His words made a very deep impression upon me, and I verily felt that some such work was before me, though I could not see how I could ever engage in its performance.  The good Lord would bring it to pass in his own good time,  he said, and that I must go on reading and studying the Scriptures. This advice and these suggestions were not without their influence on my character and destiny. He fanned my already intense love of knowledge into a flame by assuring me that I was to be a useful man in the world. When I would say to him,  How can these things be? and what can I do?  his simple reply was,   Trust in the Lord.   When I would tell him,  I am a slave, and a slave for life, how can I do anything?  he would quietly answer,  The  Lord  can make you free, my          dear; all things are possible with Him; only have  faith  in God. 'Ask, and it shall be given you.' If you want liberty, ask the Lord for it  in  FAITH,  and He will give it to you.              Thus assured and thus cheered on under the inspiration of hope, I worked and prayed with a light heart, believing that my life was under the guidance of a wisdom higher than my own. With all other blessings sought at the mercy seat, I always prayed that God would, of His great mercy, and in His own good time, deliver me from my bondage.            I went, one day, on the wharf of Mr. Waters, and seeing two Irishmen unloading a scow of stone or ballast, I went on board unasked, and helped them. When we had finished the work one of the men came to me, aside, and asked me a number of questions, and among them if I were a slave? I told him  I was a slave for life.  The good Irishman gave a shrug, and seemed deeply affected. He said it was a pity so fine a little fellow as I should be a slave for life. They both had much to say about the matter, and expressed the deepest sympathy with me, and the most decided hatred of slavery. They went so far as to tell me that I ought to run away and go to the north; that I should find friends there, and that I should then be as free as anybody. I pretended not to be interested in what they said, for I feared they might be treacherous. White men were not unfrequently known to encourage slaves to escape, and then, to get the reward, they would kidnap them and return them to their masters. While I mainly inclined to the notion that these men were honest and meant me no ill, I feared it might be otherwise. I nevertheless remembered their words and their advice, and looked forward to an escape to the north as a possible means of gaining the liberty for which my heart panted. It was not my enslavement at the then present      
   and the thought was present, that God was angry with the white people because of their slaveholding wickedness, and, therefore, his judgments were abroad in the land. It was impossible for me not to hope much from the abolition movement, when I saw it supported by the Almighty, and armed with DEATH!           Previous to my contemplation of the anti-slavery movement, and its probable results, my mind had been seriously awakened to the subject of religion. I was not more than thirteen years old, when I felt the need of God, as a father and protector. My religious nature was awakened by the preaching of a white Methodist minister, named Hanson. He thought that all men, great and small, bond and free, were sinners in the sight of God; that they were, by nature, rebels against His government; and that they must repent of their sins, and be reconciled to God, through Christ. I cannot say that I had a very distinct notion of what was required of me; but one thing I knew very well--I was wretched, and had no means of making myself otherwise. Moreover, I knew that I could pray for light. I consulted a good colored man, named Charles Johnson; and, in tones of holy affection, he told me to pray, and what to pray for. I was, for weeks, a poor, broken-hearted mourner, traveling through the darkness and misery of doubts and fears. I finally found that change of heart which comes by  casting all one's care  upon God, and by having faith in Jesus Christ, as the Redeemer, Friend, and Savior of those who diligently seek Him.           After this, I saw the world in a new light. I        seemed to live in a new world, surrounded by new objects, and to be animated by new hopes and desires. I loved all mankind--slaveholders not excepted; though I abhorred slavery more than ever. My great concern was, now, to have the world converted. The desire for knowledge increased, and especially did I want a thorough acquaintance with the contents of the bible. I have gathered scattered pages from this holy book, from the filthy street gutters of Baltimore, and washed and dried them, that in the moments of my leisure, I might get a word or two of wisdom from them. While thus religiously seeking knowledge, I became acquainted with a good old colored man, named Lawson. A more devout man than he, I never saw. He drove a dray for Mr. James Ramsey, the owner of a rope-walk on Fell's Point, Baltimore. This man not only prayed three times a day, but he prayed as he walked through the streets, at his work--on his dray--everywhere. His life was a life of prayer, and his words, (when he spoke to his friends,) were about a better world. Uncle Lawson lived near Master Hugh's house; and, becoming deeply attached to the old man, I went often with him to prayer-meeting, and spent much of my leisure time with him on Sunday. The old man could read a little, and I was a great help to him, in making out the hard words, for I was a better reader than he. I could teach him   the letter,   but he could teach me   the spirit;   and high, refreshing times we had together, in singing, praying and glorifying God. These meetings with Uncle Lawson went on for a long time, without the knowledge of Master Hugh or       my mistress. Both knew, however, that I had become religious, and they seemed to respect my conscientious piety. My mistress was still a professor of religion, and belonged to class. Her leader was no less a person than the Rev. Beverly Waugh, the presiding elder, and now one of the bishops of the Methodist Episcopal church. Mr. Waugh was then stationed over Wilk street church. I am careful to state these facts, that the reader may be able to form an idea of the precise influences which had to do with shaping and directing my mind.           In view of the cares and anxieties incident to the life she was then leading, and, especially, in view of the separation from religious associations to which she was subjected, my mistress had, as I have before stated, become lukewarm, and needed to be looked up by her leader. This brought Mr. Waugh to our house, and gave me an opportunity to hear him exhort and pray. But my chief instructor, in matters of religion, was Uncle Lawson. He was my spiritual father; and I loved him intensely, and was at his house every chance I got.           This pleasure was not long allowed me. Master Hugh became averse to my going to Father Lawson's, and threatened to whip me if I ever went there again. I now felt myself persecuted by a wicked man; and I  would  go to Father Lawson's, notwithstanding the threat. The good old man had told me, that the  Lord had a great work for me to do;  and I must prepare to do it; and that he had been shown that I must preach the gospel. His words made a deep impression on my mind, and I verily felt that some such        work was before me, though I could not see  how  I should ever engage in its performance.  The good Lord,  he said,  would bring it to pass in his own good time,  and that I must go on reading and studying the scriptures. The advice and the suggestions of Uncle Lawson, were not without their influence upon my character and destiny. He threw my thoughts into a channel from which they have never entirely diverged. He fanned my already intense love of knowledge into a flame, by assuring me that I was to be a useful man in the world. When I would say to him,  How can these things be--and what can  I  do?  his simple reply was,   Trust in the Lord.   When I told him that  I was a slave, and a slave FOR LIFE,  he said,  the Lord can make you free, my dear. All things are possible with him, only  have faith in God.    Ask, and it shall be given.   If you want liberty,  said the good old man,  ask the Lord for it,  in faith,  AND HE WILL GIVE IT TO YOU.            Thus assured, and cheered on, under the inspiration of hope, I worked and prayed with a light heart, believing that my life was under the guidance of a wisdom higher than my own. With all other blessings sought at the mercy seat, I always prayed that God would, of His great mercy, and in His own good time, deliver me from my bondage.           I went, one day, on the wharf of Mr. Waters; and seeing two Irishmen unloading a large scow of stone, or ballast, I went on board, unasked, and helped them. When we had finished the work, one of the men came to me, aside, and asked me a number of questions, and among them, if I were a slave. I told him     
       MEMOIR,  C.            In the following Narrative of  OLD ELIZABETH,  which was taken mainly from her own lips in her 97th year, her  simple language has been adhered to as strictly as was  consistent with perspicuity and propriety.             I was born in Maryland in the year 1766. My  parents were slaves. Both my father and mother were  religious people, and belonged to the Methodist  Society. It was my father's practice to read in the  Bible aloud to his children every sabbath morning.  At these seasons, when I was but five years old, I often  felt the overshadowing of the Lord's Spirit, without  at all understanding what it meant; and these incomes and influences continued to attend me until  I was eleven years old, particularly when I was alone,  by which I was preserved from doing anything that  I thought was wrong.             In the eleventh year of my age, my master sent  me to another farm, several miles from my parents,  brothers, and sisters, which was a great trouble to  me. At last I grew so lonely and sad I thought I  should die, if I did not see my mother. I asked the           overseer if I might go, but being positively denied, I concluded to go without his knowledge. When I reached home my mother was away. I set off and walked twenty miles before I found her. I staid with her for several days, and we returned together. Next day I was sent back to my new place, which renewed my sorrow. At parting, my mother told me that I had,  nobody in the wide world to look to but God.  These words fell upon my heart with  pondrous  weight, and seemed to add to my grief. I went back repeating as I went,  none but God in the wide world.  On reaching the farm, I found the overseer was displeased at me for going without  his liberty. He tied me with a rope, and gave me some stripes of which I carried the marks for weeks.             After this time, finding as my mother said, I had none in the world to look to but God, I betook  myself to prayer, and in every lonely place I found an altar. I mourned sore like a dove and chattered forth my sorrow, moaning in the corners of the field, and under the fences.             I continued in this state for about six months, feeling  as though my head were waters, and I could do nothing but weep. I lost my appetite, and not  being able to take enough food to sustain nature, I  became so weak I had but little strength to work; still I was required to do all my duty. One evening,            after the duties of the day were ended, I thought I could not live over the night, so threw myself on a bench, expecting to die, and without being prepared to meet my Maker; and my spirit cried within me, must I die in this state, and be banished from Thy presence forever? I own I am a sinner in Thy sight, and not fit to live where thou art. Still it was my fervent desire that the Lord would pardon me. Just at this season, I saw with my spiritual eye, an awful gulf of misery. As I thought I was about to plunge into it, I heard a voice saying,  rise up and pray,  which strengthened me. I fell on my knees and prayed the best I could the Lord's prayer. Knowing  no more to say, I halted, but continued on my knees. My spirit was then  taught  to pray,  Lord, have mercy on me--Christ save me.  Immediately there appeared a director, clothed in white raiment. I thought he took me by the hand and said,  come with me.  He led me down a long journey to a fiery gulf, and left me standing upon the brink of this awful pit. I began to scream for mercy, thinking I was about to be plunged to the belly of hell, and  believed I should sink to endless ruin. Although I prayed and wrestled with all my might, it seemed in vain. Still, I felt all the while that I was  sustained by some invisible power. At this solemn  moment, I thought I saw a hand from which hung, as it were, a silver hair, and a voice told me that all           the hope I had of being saved was no more than a  hair; still, pray, and it will be sufficient. I then  renewed my struggle, crying for mercy and salvation,  until I found that every cry raised me higher and  higher, and my head was quite above the fiery pillars.  Then I thought I was permitted to look straight  forward, and saw the Saviour standing with His hand  stretched out to receive me. An indescribably  glorious light was  in  Him, and He said,  peace, peace,  come unto me.  At this moment I felt that my sins  were forgiven me, and the time of my deliverance  was at hand. I sprang forward and fell at his feet,  giving Him all the thanks and highest praises, crying,  Thou hast redeemed me--Thou hast redeemed  me to thyself. I felt filled with light and love. At  this moment I thought my former guide took me  again by the hand and led me upward, till I came to  the celestial world and to heaven's door, which I saw  was open, and while I stood there, a power surrounded me which drew me in, and I saw millions  of glorified spirits in white robes. After I had this  view, I thought I heard a voice saying,  Art thou  willing to be saved?  I said, Yes Lord. Again I was  asked,  Art thou willing to be saved in my way?  I stood speechless until he asked me again,  Art  thou willing to be saved in my way?  Then I heard  a whispering voice say,  If thou art not saved in the  Lord's way, thou canst not be saved at all;  at which           I exclaimed,  Yes Lord, in thy own way.  Immediately  a light fell upon my head, and I was filled  with light, and I was shown the world lying in wickedness,  and was told I must go there, and call the  people to repentance, for the day of the Lord was at  hand; and this message was as a heavy yoke upon  me, so that I wept bitterly at the thought of what I  should have to pass through. While I wept, I heard  a voice say,  weep not, some will laugh at thee, some will scoff at thee, and the dogs will bark at  thee, but while thou doest my will, I will be with  thee to the ends of the earth. [ ]              I was at this time not yet thirteen years old. The  next day, when I had come to myself, I felt like a  new creature in Christ, and all my desire was to see  the Saviour.             I lived in a place where there was no preaching,  and no religious instruction; but every day I went out  amongst the hay-stacks, where the presence of the  Lord overshadowed me, and I was filled with sweetness  and joy, and was as a vessel filled with holy oil.  In this way I continued for about a year; many  times while my hands were at my work, my spirit  was carried away to spiritual things. One day as I  was going to my old place behind the hay-stacks to  pray, I was assailed with this language,  Are you  going there to weep and pray? what a fool! there  are older professors than you are, and they do not           take that way to get to heaven; people whose sins  are forgiven ought to be joyful and lively, and not  be struggling and praying.  With this I halted and  concluded I would not go, but do as other professors  did, and so went off to play; but at this moment  the light that was in me became darkened, and the  peace and joy that I once had, departed from me.             About this time I was moved back to the farm  where my mother lived, and then sold to a stranger.  Here I had deep sorrows and plungings, not having  experienced a return of that sweet evidence and  light with which I had been favoured formerly; but  by watching unto prayer, and wrestling mightily  with the Lord, my peace gradually returned, and  with it a great exercise and weight upon my heart  for the salvation of my fellow-creatures; and I was often carried to distant lands and shown places where  I should have to travel and deliver the Lord's message. Years afterwards, I found myself visiting  those towns and countries that I had seen in the  light as I sat it home at my sewing,--places of  which I had never heard.             Some years from this time I was sold to a  Presbyterian for a term of years, as he did not think it  right to hold slaves for life. Having served him  faithfully my time out, he gave me my liberty,  which was about the thirtieth year of my age.             As I now lived in a neighborhood where I could           attend religious meetings, occasionally I felt moved to speak a few words therein; but I shrank from it--so great was the cross to my nature.             I did not speak much till I had reached my forty-second year, when it was revealed to me that the message which had been given to me I had not yet delivered, and the time had come. As I could read but little, I questioned within myself how it would be possible for me to deliver the message, when I did not understand the Scriptures. Whereupon I was moved to open a Bible that was near me, which I did, and my eyes fell upon this passage,  Gird up thy loins now like a man, and answer thou me. Obey God rather than man,  c.  Here I fell into a great exercise of spirit, and was plunged very low. I went from one religious professor to another, enquiring of them what ailed me; but of all these I could find none who could throw any light upon such impressions. They all told me there was nothing in Scripture that would sanction such exercises. It was hard for men to travel, and what would women do? These things greatly discouraged me, and shut up my way, and caused me to resist the Spirit. After going to all that were accounted pious, and receiving no help, I returned to the Lord, feeling that I was nothing, and knew nothing, and wrestled and prayed to the Lord that he would fully reveal His will, and make the way plain.                     Whilst I thus struggled, there seemed a light from heaven to fall upon me, which banished all my desponding fears, and I was enabled to form a new resolution to go on to prison and to death, if it might be my portion: and the Lord showed me that it was His will I should be resigned to die any death that might be my lot, in carrying his message, and be entirely crucified to the world, and sacrifice  all  to His glory that was then in my possession, which His witnesses, the holy Apostles, had done before me. It was then revealed to me that the Lord had given me the evidence of a clean heart, in which I could rejoice day and night, and I walked and talked with God, and my soul was illuminated with heavenly light, and I knew nothing but Jesus Christ, and him crucified.             One day, after those things, while I was at my work, the Spirit directed me to go to a poor widow, and ask her if I might have a meeting at her house,  which was situated in one of the lowest and worst streets in Baltimore. With great joy she gave  notice, and at the time appointed I appeared there among a few coloured sisters. When they had all prayed, they called upon me to close the meeting, and I felt an impression that I must say a few words; and while I was speaking, the house seemed filled with light; and when I was about to close the meeting,  and was kneeling, a man came in and stood till           I arose. It proved to be a watchman. The sisters became so frightened, they all went away except the one who lived in the house, and an old woman; they both appeared to be much frightened, fearing they should receive some personal injury, or be put out of the house. A feeling of weakness came over me for a short time, but I soon grew warm and courageous in the Spirit. The man then said to me,  I was sent here to break up your meeting. Complaint has been made to me that the people round here cannot sleep for the racket.  I replied,  a good racket is better than a bad racket. How do they rest when the ungodly are dancing and fiddling till midnight? Why are not they molested by the watchmen? and why should we be for praising God, our Maker? Are we worthy of greater punishment for praying to Him? and are we to be prohibited from doing so, that sinners may remain slumbering in their sins?  While speaking these few words I grew warm with  heavenly  zeal, and laid my hand upon him and addressed him with gospel truth,  how do sinners sleep in hell, after slumbering in their sins here, and crying, 'let me rest, let me rest,' while sporting on the very brink of hell? Is the cause of God to be destroyed for this purpose?   Speaking several words more to this amount, he turned pale and trembled, and begged my pardon, acknowledging that it was not his wish to interrupt us, and that           he would never disturb a religious assembly again. He then took leave of me in a comely manner and wished us success. After he was gone, I turned to the old sisters who by this time were quite cheered up. You see, said I, if the sisters had not fled, what a victory we might have had on the Lord's side; for the man seemed ready to give up under conviction. If it had not been for their cowardice, we might have all bowed in prayer, and a shout of victory had been heard amongst us.             Our meeting gave great offence, and we were forbid holding any more assemblies. Even the elders of our meeting joined with the wicked people, and said such meetings must be stopped, and that woman quieted. But I was not afraid of any of them, and continued to go, and burnt with a zeal not my own. The old sisters were zealous sometimes, and at other times would sink under the cross. Thus they grow cold, at which I was much grieved. I proposed to them to ask the elders to send a brother, which was concluded upon.             We went on for several years, and the Lord was with us with great power it proved, to the conversion of many souls, and we continued to grow stronger.             I felt at times that I must exercise in the ministry, but when I rose upon my feet I felt  ashmed , and so I went under a cloud for some time, and endeavoured           to keep silence; but I could not quench the Spirit. I was rejected by the elders and rulers, as Christ was rejected by the Jews before me, and while others were excused in crimes of the darkest dye, I was hunted down in every place where I  appointed a meeting. Wading through many sorrows, I thought at times I might as well be banished from this life, as to feel the Almighty drawing me one way, and man another; so that I was tempted to cast myself into the dock. But contemplating the length of eternity, and how long my sufferings would be in that unchangeable world, compared with this, if I endured a little longer, the Lord was pleased to deliver me from this gloomy, melancholy state in his own time; though while this temptation lasted I roved up and down, and talked and prayed.             I often felt that I was unfit to assemble with the  congregation with whom I had gathered, and had sometimes been made to rejoice in the Lord. I felt that I was despised on account of this gracious calling, and was looked upon as a speckled bird by the ministers to whom I looked for instruction, and to whom I resorted every opportunity for the same; but when I would converse with them, some would cry out,  You are an enthusiast;  and others said,  the Discipline did not allow of any such division of the work;  until I began to think I surely must be wrong. Under this reflection, I had another gloomy           cloud to struggle through; but after awhile I felt much moved upon by the Spirit of the Lord, and meeting with an aged sister, I found upon conversing with her that she could sympathize with me in this spiritual work. She was the first one I had met with, who could fully understand my exercises. She offered to open her house for a meeting, and run the risk of all the church would do to her for it. Many were afraid to open their houses in this way, lest they should be turned out of the church.             I persevered, notwithstanding the opposition of those who were looked upon as higher and wiser. The meeting was appointed, and but few came. I felt much backwardness, and as though I could not pray, but a pressure upon me to arise and express myself by way of exhortation. After hesitating for some time whether I would take up the cross or no, I arose, and after expressing a few words, the Spirit came upon me with life, and a victory was gained over the power of darkness, and we could rejoice together in His love.             As for myself, I was so full I hardly knew whether I was in the body, or out of the body--so great was my joy for the victory on the Lord's side. But the persecution against me  increased, and a complaint was carried forward, as was  done formerly against Daniel, the servant of God, and  the elders came out           with indignation for my holding meetings contrary to discipline--being a woman.             Thus we see when the heart is not inspired, and the inward eye enlightened by the Spirit, we are incapable of discerning the mystery of God in these things. Individuals creep into the church that are unregenerate, and after they have been there awhile, they fancy that they have got the grace of God, while they are destitute of it. They may have a degree of light in their heads, but evil in their hearts; which makes them think they are qualified to be judges of the ministry, and their conceit makes them very busy in matters of religion, judging of the revelations that are given to others, while they have received none themselves. Being thus mistaken, they are calculated to make a great deal of confusion in the church, and clog the true ministry.             These are they who eat their own bread, and wear their own apparel, having the form of godliness, but are destitute of the power.             Again I felt encouraged to attend another and  another appointment. At one of these meetings, some of the class-leaders were present, who were  constrained to cry out,  Surely the Lord has  revealed  these things to her  and asked one another if they ever heard the like? I look upon man as a very selfish being, when placed in a religious office, to presume to resist the work of the Almighty;           because He does not work by man's authority. I did  not faint under discouragement, but pressed on.             Under the contemplation of these things, I slept but little, being much engaged in receiving the revelations of the Divine will concerning this work, and the mysterious call thereto.             I felt very unworthy and small, notwithstanding the Lord had shown himself with great power, insomuch that conjecturers and critics were constrained to join in praise to his great name; for truly, we had times of refreshing from the presence of the Lord. At one of the meetings, a vast number of the white inhabitants of the place, and many coloured people, attended--many no doubt from curiosity to hear what the old coloured woman had to say. One, a great scripturian, fixed himself behind the door with pen and ink, in order to take down the discourse in short-hand; but the Almighty Being anointed me with such a portion of his Spirit, that he cast away his paper and pen, and heard the discourse with patience, and was much affected, for the Lord wrought powerfully on his heart. After meeting, he came forward and offered me his hand with solemnity on his countenance, and handed me something to pay for my conveyance home.             I returned, much strengthened by the Lord's power, to go on to the  fulfilment  of His work, although I was again pressed by the authorities of           the church to which I belonged, for imprudency; and so much condemned, that I was sorely tempted by the enemy to turn aside into the wilderness. I was so embarrassed and encompassed, I wondered within myself whether all that were called to be mouth piece for the Lord, suffered such deep wadings as I experienced.             I now found I had to travel still more extensively in the work of the ministry, and I applied to the Lord for direction. I was often  invited  to go hither and thither, but felt that I must wait for the dictates of His Spirit.             At a meeting which I held in Maryland, I was led to speak from the passage,  Woe to the rebellious city,  c. After the meeting, the people came where I was, to take me before the squire; but the Lord delivered me from their hands.             I also held meetings in Virginia. The people there would not believe that a coloured woman could preach. And moreover, as she had no learning, they strove to imprison me because I spoke against slavery: and being brought up, they asked by what authority I spake? and if I had been ordained? I answered, not by the commission of men's hands: if the Lord had ordained me, I needed nothing better.             As I travelled along through the land, I was led at different times to converse with white men who           were by profession ministers of the gospel. Many of them, up and down, confessed they did not believe in revelation, which gave me to see that men were sent forth as ministers without Christ's authority. In a conversation with one of these, he said,  You think you have these things by revelation, but there has been no such thing as revelation since Christ's ascension.  I asked him where the apostle John got his revelation while he was in the Isle of Patmos. With this, he rose up and left me, and I said in my spirit, get thee behind me Satan.             I visited many remote places, where there were no meeting houses, and held many  glorions  meetings, for the Lord poured out his Spirit in sweet effusions. I also travelled in Canada, and visited several settlements of coloured people, and felt an open door amongst them.             I may here remark, that while journeying through the different states of the Union, I met with many of the Quaker Friends, and visited them in their families. I received much kindness and sympathy, and no opposition from them, in the prosecution of my labours.             On one occasion, in a thinly settled part of the country, seeing a Friend's meeting house open, I went in; at the same time a Friend and his little daughter followed me. We three composed the meeting. As we sat there in silence, I felt a            remarkable overshadowing of the Divine presence, as much so as I ever experienced any where. Toward the close, a few words seemed to be given me, which I expressed, and left the place greatly refreshed in Spirit. From thence I went to Michigan, where I found a wide field of labour amongst my own colour. Here I remained four years. I established a school for coloured orphans, having always felt the great importance of the religious and moral  agri culture of children, and the great need of it, especially amongst the coloured people. Having white teachers, I met with much encouragement.             My eighty-seventh year had now arrived, when suffering from disease, and feeling released from travelling further in my good Master's cause, I came on to Philadelphia, where I have remained until this time, which brings me to my  ninety-seventh year. When I went forth, it was without purse or scrip,--and I have come through great tribulation and temptation--not by any might of my own, for I feel that I am but as dust and ashes before my almighty Helper, who has, according to His promise, been with me and sustained me through all, and gives me now firm faith that he will be with me to the end, and, in his own good time, receive me into His everlasting rest.

   or consent to it. But condemned by the laws of the State in which he lives, you know he is  yours  no longer, and pardoning him as I now do, he is a free man, indeed.  After this the colored people built him a church in Blandford, and thus the Lord increased his usefulness by the very means intended to end it, and he was there ministering when John came away.           It may be said to the credit of Virginia's statesmen that this iniquitous law did not continue long in force.           John speaks of a Mr. Bradley, in Chesterfield County, whom he knew in his youth as a notedly brutal master.--When angry, he would heat a poker in the fire, and lay it himself on the naked backs of his poor slaves, but his good wife mourned his cruelty, and did all in her power to alleviate their sorrows and their sufferings.           This man one time, at the solicitation of his wife, attended her to a camp meeting. By the words there heard, he was so wrought upon in view of his sins, that John, with others, had to carry him to his home, where, for three days, his terror was so great that no one ventured near him.--Then he opened his mouth in praises to God for sparing a wretch like him. He called his slaves together, and asked their forgiveness for his barbarity--said Satan had moved him hitherto, but Christ now was in his soul. His kindness and christian character ever after proved the change to be genuine, and from being hated and feared, he was beloved and truly lamented when his death took place, and to John and to many persons his conversion was blessed, attesting to them the nature of that religion which could convert a lion into a lamb.           The Guilfield church alluded to heretofore, is just out of Petersburg, and was erected by the labors and the contributions of the colored people of Petersburg. John's own hands     
      he lived with her fifty years; then for several years had no wife, and his last wife, who died two years before him, said that she had lived with him twenty-eight years. He also stated that he was set free by his last master and sent to Canada, partly because he was more than one hundred years old, and by right of age deserved to be his own man. He delighted in telling of the scenes of his early life, and his narrations would so accord with the pages of history as to make it evident that he had lived as far off from the present as he asserted. Certainly he was a wonderful man as an  ante-revolutionary relic.              But he was still more interesting and wonderful because of his  religion . He accounted for his long life in part by saying:  I neber worked bery hard. When I was a boy I chored 'bout house, and den for about sixty years I blowed de gospel trumpet on de plantation for 'bout six months ob de year, to make de slaves good and 'ligious, and I tell ye, massa, when I was in my prime, say along  'bout eighty , I could blow de old trumpet so dat dey could hear me for miles.  His own account of his early religious knowledge and experience was about as follows:                      I was quite a chunk of a boy afore I hearn much about 'ligion, afore I hearn much about dis glorious gospel.              Once in 'bout a year one o' dem clergy dat com'd ober de big water com'd round and preached up all de funerals ob de slaves dat died sen he com'd afore, and sometimes I feels very bad den. But after a bit dere com'd round one ob de big men from de college in de Jarseys,  *        * This it seems probable was the  eloquent President Davies.   and he telled us 'bout de matter werry solemn.   But I know nothing den about Jesus.  And now the tears began to trickle down the old man's cheeks.              An' den dar com'd along dat man dat died an' den com'd to life again, an' he telled de slaves 'bout Jesus. Oh, wat was he name? I don't mind now.  I suggested  William Tennent .  Oh, yes, massa!  Willie Tennent ! Glory to God! I been tryin to tink ob dat name dese many years. I knowed I should know him in glory, but now I will call him by name jus as soon as I sees him. After I heard him how I did feel! Wen I was walking on de ground it would keep sayin' ' Unworthy! unworthy! ' Wen I took a bit ob            bread, or a cup ob water, dey keep sayin' ' Unworthy! unworthy! ' Wen I goes into de field all de trees keep sayin' ' Unworthy! unworthy! ' Wen I goes into de yard I sees dat all de cattle kneels down afore dey lies down, an' I neber done dat. O massa, I thought I should die. I feels so bad.  (Then he would go on in various terms to tell of his utter despair.)  But bimbye dere com'd along a colored man who telled me des no use in my libin' dat way. He telled me ob de passage dat says: 'Behold de Lamb of God dat takes away de sins ob de world;' an' den I goes into de woods, an' all night I cries, 'O Lamb of God, hab mercy on dis poor man; [']  an' I cries an' prays dis ober an' ober; an', O massa! just as de light was coming ober de mountains ob ole Virginia de light of Jesus shined into dis poor soul, an' from dat day on, now about a hundred years, I've been tryin' to tell to saints and sinners round what a dear Saviour I have found.              He was ever magnifying the grace that rescued such a sinner as he, and that had sustained and comforted him in his long and weary pilgrimage. We have never known one whose soul would so soon melt and flow           down in the presence of the great facts of infinite love and mercy. The name of Jesus was the greatest and best of all names to him. Not unfrequently he would utter that dear name over and over, with tones, and tears, and gestures of gratitude and praise.             The old man was favorably situated for enjoying ejaculatory worship; and he  diligently improved and richly enjoyed his opportunities. For about five days in each week he was alone in the most of the day; his wife, who was sixty years younger than himself, having gone out to work in neighboring families, and his two children, born after he was one hundred years old, having gone to school or to play. During their absence he would often spend hours in talking, and praying, and singing. Sometimes, as one of my children said, he appeared to  play meeting.  Sitting in his chair by the side of his house with his Bible on his knee he would slowly read (without glasses) and expound and preach as if a congregation were present; then would follow singing and prayer in a manner which would indicate that Christ himself were present. We called upon him one day just as he closed one of these services.           As soon as he saw us he cried out, with tears flowing down his face:  O massa! Jesus has been here, an' I tought I was in glory; but I will be dere bimbye.               You mean to be faithful to the end, Uncle Johnson?  I said.              O massa, I'se bound for de kingdom. I'se not been holding on all dis way to fail jus at de gate.              Once, as I interrupted him upon one of these occasions, he exclaimed:              O massa! de Lord is passing by; does you want to speak to him?              I can call to mind many interesting incidents concerning him, but will mention only a few of such as made the most impression upon my mind at the time. His voice and manner were such as to give his declarations a power that they cannot have upon the lifeless page. The reader needs to imagine his earnest manner and emotional utterance with the tone common among preachers and exhorters at the South many years ago. The fact, too, that he did not appear to know that he had said anything interesting when he had uttered thoughts as rich as human language can express, gave to his words a peculiar           charm. They would come forth as spontaneously as if they were the natural outflow of his soul, as if they were specimens of the rich quarry within, or as if God would thus show what can be wrought in a heart that gives him entire dominion.             One day while he was at work in his garden, singing and shouting, I said:  You seem happy to-day.               Yes, massa, I'se jus tinking.               ' What are you thinking of?               Oh I'se jus tinking;  (and then his emotions prevented utterance.)  I'se jus tinking dat ef de crumbs dat fall from de Master's table, in dis world, am so good, wat will de GREAT LOAF in glory be! I tells ye, massa, dar will be nuff an' to spare dare.              At another time when he seemed very happy and I had heard him shout,  Lord Jesus, will dere be one for me?  I said,  You are having a good time to-day, uncle?  He answered:              O massa, I was meditatin' about Jesus bein'  de Carpenter ; an' so he can make mansions for his people in glory.  And then with uplifted face and with tears he cried out,  O Jesus, will dar be one for me?            Once I said to him,  Uncle Johnson, why don't you go to church once in awhile?  He answered,  Massa, I wants to be dere, but I can't ' have .               You can't  behave ?               Well, massa, you knows, late years, de flesh be weak; an' when dey 'gins to talk and sing about Jesus I 'gins to fill up, and putty soon I has to holler, and den dey say, 'Carry dat man to de door, he 'sturb de meetin'.               But you should hold in until you get home.               O massa, I can't hold in--I  bust  if I don't holler.              Once, after hearing him pray and sing at midnight while a thunder-storm was passing, in the morning I said,  Was that you shouting so last night?               Yes, massa, I 'spose.               Well, I thought the thunder made noise enough without your hallooing.              He looked up, and with astonishment said:  Massa, do you tink I'se goin' to lie dere on my bed like a great pig, wen de Lord com'd along shakin' de earth and de heavens? No, massa, when I hears de thun'er coming, I says, 'Ellen, Ellen, wake up here,  we's goin' to hear from home ag'in .'                       One morning when I had heard him for an hour or two, I went carefully to his door and saw him sitting at the end of his table with a humble repast before him, while his hands were lifted high in gratitude and praise. I said,  You seem happy this morning?               Oh, yes, Ellen went away to her work, and so I gets me breakfast and den begins to say grace; an', O massa, de Lord am  so good , seems I neber will be done sayin' grace!              What a rebuke to those who sit down to loaded tables with no thought of their Benefactor!             Gratitude to God for his daily mercies was one of his most distinct peculiarities. If he received a gift from his neighbor he ever evinced an appreciation of the kindness of the giver; and then, at once, his eye would be lifted toward heaven, and some expressions would clearly indicate his heart's response to Him from whom we receive every good and perfect gift. Many things, received from time to time, were regarded by him, and spoken of as if they came in answer to prayer. He said,  When I wants anything I asks de Lord, and he's sure to send it, sometimes           afore I done asking, an' sometimes he waits jus to see if I trusts him.              Once when we indicated a little skepticism upon this subject, he said:              Massa, don't you know dat de Lord send de ravens to feed de prophet? Him is jus as good now as den.              We chanced to be present when one called with whom he was not acquainted. After entering and shaking the old man by the hand, he said:  Is this Uncle Johnson? I have often heard of you, and have meant sometime to see you. But as I was passing just now something said to me, 'Go in there and give the old man a dollar.' I said, 'I can't do it;' and again something said: 'Go in there, I tell you, and give him a dollar.' So here it is, get anything you please with it.               Yes, massa, thank you, thank you. I tought de Lord would send you dis afternoon. Sit down, sit down.               No, not now, I am in a hurry. I hope you are getting along comfortably. Good-bye.               Hold! hold! Massa! Afore you go I wants to know if you are bound for de           kingdom? May-be I'll neber see you again. Am you bound for dat land of pure delight, where saints immortal reign? Hab you de passport?               The what?               De  passport  all signed and sealed wid de blood of Jesus. You must hab dat, massa, or you neber will get fru de gates ob de city.              In some such manner as this he would improve every opportunity of doing good to those who came in his way. He would with perfect naturalness run all conversation into a religious channel.  Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.  He was perpetually saying such things as declared plainly that he was seeking a country, that is, an heavenly.             His anticipations of the heavenly inheritance were such that at times he thought himself in full possession. Said he:  Sometimes when I'se walking up and down in dis cabin, praising de Lord, I thinks I am in heaven; I thinks dis is one ob de mansions dat Jesus gives his people. Den dis world is under my feet. I jus sees it a great way off, and I jus cries: O my God! am I in glory?                       But how do you feel when you find that you are not there?               I has a long crying, and den I says, I will wait my appointed time.              How long would you be willing to wait?               I will wait anuder hundred Years,  if de Lord please .              Realizing his need of fitness for heaven we heard him praying one night:  O Lord, anoint our souls with angels' balm, that when we have done with dis world we may be at home in glory.              His voice was so strong and his soul so fervent that he was heard in his devotions for a great distance around, especially at evening, in the season of summer. Many were necessitated to hear the accents of prayer and praise, though themselves never uttered them. Some persons doubtless were annoyed by this, and yet in various ways they would indicate their approbation of his manner of life. Many a wicked man laid himself down and rested all the more quietly, by reason of the sense of safety inspired by the prayer he was compelled to hear, before retiring; and many a one was waked to the active duties of a new day by the early           praises of this aged pilgrim who seemed to welcome each coming morning as bringing him nearer home.             He uniformly rose early, but especially early on the Sabbath. When we asked him why he did so he said:  De Lord get up early  dat day . De women dat went to de  sepulcre  got dere early, and den de Lord was not dere. De earlier I gets up de more I sees ob Jesus.              By reason of his infirmities he could not attend upon the services of the sanctuary, but said he:  I  puts up  for you ebery day; I always pray den for all dat blows de gospel trumpet.              Nothing rejoiced him more than to hear that sinners were inquiring the way to the Saviour. Such tidings would make him weep for joy. Once, lifting his hands, he cried:  O Lord, call dem in. Ho Lord! Make dem willing in de day of dy power.              Once, in illustrating that sinners should be more in earnest, he said:  Many tink dey be seeking and seeking 'ligion, and dey be jus putting it off all de time; dey must  lay right down to it ,  jus as de hos would to de dray, or dey neber can get free. You           know de gate is narrow --   'tis mighty narrow !              His confidence in the word of God was unbounded. Let him be sure that the Lord had said anything, and nothing could shake his faith in it. We were mentioning this fact to a friend one day just as we were going over to call on the old man. So, after having been there a while, my friend said:              Uncle Johnson, you believe so and so,  naming some fundamental doctrine of the gospel.              Yes, massa, I believes dat.               What makes you believe that?               'Cause, massa, you knows dat de Lord says so,  quoting a passage or two.              Well, Uncle Johnson, you believe so and so,  (naming another doctrine, seemingly antagonistic to the former.)              Yes, massa, I believes dat, too, 'cause de Lord said,  and then he quoted again.              But see here, uncle, both of those things can't be true; you said you believed so and so, and also  so and so . Now how do you  reconcile  these two things? They can't both be true, in the nature of things; it is not philosophical that both should be true.  And          thus my friend went on attempting to confuse the old man with metaphysical subtleties.             Uncle Johnson heard him for a while, and then lifting himself from his chair, and in a manner indicating grief and impatience, said:              Massa, I knows nothing about your  philosophies  and your  natur ob tings , but I knows dat de Lord said dem tings, an' I hab tried de Lord more dan a hundred years, (weeping,) and I'se not going now to gib up  one ting dat he said .              Having said this he sat down. My friend turned and said to me, in a low tone:  That will do; I give it up.              He seemed to have so long rested upon the simple declarations of God, and to have had so many fulfilments of the promises in his own experience, that anything intimated or said in a manner indicating distrust of these things was regarded with no degree of allowance. It seemed hard for him to believe that a man can be a Christian and indulge in any measure of skepticism concerning anything that is clearly revealed. For  the philosophies of religion  he cared nothing. Its grand and glorious  facts  were           great enough and rich enough for his capacities. He had a confidence in God so strong as to believe that there are good reasons for all his assertions, and that he need not trouble himself with an endeavor to look into them. Oh! how well it would have been for many if they had been like poor old Uncle Johnson! Very few know enough to make it worth while to be curiously inquisitive of divine secrets. Simply  to trust  is the most profitable way of learning the things of the divine kingdom. God makes his most blessed revelations to those who most completely confide. This we often thought when staggering home under the weight of some of Uncle Johnson's simple but almost inspired utterances.             But while we were marking the general tenor of that life of faith and prayer, we gave it a new attention, as it revealed itself, under the chastenings of affliction. A great sorrow overtook him in the death of his wife, about two years before his own release. She rapidly but very trustfully went into the valley of the shadow of death. Returning from an evening appointment we were told that she was dying. Hastening over we found         that the spirit had just taken its departure, and then we saw and heard what we can never adequately describe. What a figure of grief and triumph in the presence of the stillness and solemnity of death!             This aged one, standing by the bedside of the lifeless form of his wife, with uplifted face and hands, was crying:  Farewell, Ellen --  farewell, my dear Ellen; must you leave me! must you leave me! O Jesus! my dear Ellen is coming! Gib her one ob de mansions till I come; Lord Jesus! How can I wait? Send de chariot again.              Such like expressions were numerous until the tide of his emotions had subsided; then, kneeling by the bedside, he breathed his sorrows into the ear of his Saviour in such a prayer as we never expect to hear again.             From that hour on, through the funeral occasion and in the days following, his spirit and manner were beautiful beyond description. Being human he often felt lonely, and believing that he would ultimately attain heaven, he greatly longed to be there. We said to him one day:              Uncle Johnson, don't you feel lonely since Ellen left you?                      Oh yes, massa, I feels berry lonely, but den de Lord comes round ebery day and gives me a taste ob de kingdom, jus as de nus would wid de spoon; but, oh! how  I wants to get hold ob de dish ,  (suiting the manner to the words.)             Ever after Ellen's death he seemed only waiting as he said  for dat chariot to come again.  Once, after he had been ill for a few days, as he began to get out again, I said:  I thought that your appointed time had about come.  He replied:  Oh, yes, I tought dat day dat I could see de dust ob de chariot coming ober de mountains, an' den somethin' said, 'Hold on, Johnson, a little longer; I'll come round directly.' Yes, massa, an' I will hold on, if de Lord please, anoder hundred years! for I'se bound for Canaan.  Then he broke out singing:      But this I do find we two am so jin'd,                 During those days he would often bid his friends farewell,  till we meets in glory.              One day the Rev. Dr. H -- called on him with me. After a conversation which, surely my friend will never forget, he said:  I must now go; good-bye, Uncle Johnson;           I shall probably hear soon that you have gone over Jordan, but we will follow on.               Oh, yes massa, great many years ago young men like you tell me dat, an' den after a bit I'd hear dat dey had gone home, an' I am a pilgrim yet, but I always manages to send word.               Well if I should die first,  said Dr. H  --,  what word would you send?               O massa, if you get home afore I do,  (weeping,)  tell 'em to keep de table standin' , for Johnson is holding on his way.  I'se bound to be dere .              We might record other incidents and expressions, but they would be like those already given. Many who have visited him, and who may see these pages, will wonder that we have not told of what he said when they were present. We have narrated only such things as made the deepest impression upon our own mind, and which we have retained by notes made at the time, or by repeating them.             Since the death of his wife the old man has been almost wholly dependent upon his neighbors for daily bread. Those women who have ministered to his comfort, or more     
    as I did not let him see the horse he never found out my scrape, and it is well he did not, for if he had, I might not have been here to record it. He was cross to me and I feared him like death. I  reccollect  once his whipping me, after our return from Northumberland, so severely on the naked back, that I carry the stripes to this day, and all because his mother told him that I had been telling his younger brother something that was done when he lived at Northumberland. He gave me once a tumbler of spirits, and made me drink it, which almost killed me. This he did to conceal from my knowledge, a scrape which he was going to have, as I supposed If the cook had not blown tobacco smoke through me, I believe I should have been a corpse before morning.            After staying at Northumberland six or eight months, master George left there, and I went back to his father's plantation, I went sorrowing too. Master George was going to Philadelphia again, so there was no other place for me but his father's plantation, where I must work all day, and some times most all night, with my peck of meal a week, and the hell-hound Burrows, to flog me, for he gloried in doing it. One instance in which my master disappointed his savage heart, I remember. He told Burrows to take me down to the stable, tie my legs, put a rail between them, then stretch me up and whip me. While going down to the stable, which was about thirty or forty rods distant, I thought if the order was put in execution, I could not endure it, but must die in the operation. My master and. Burrows went forward, and I followed behind. I looked up to heaven, and prayed fervently to God to hear my prayer, and grant me relief in this hour of  adverversity ; expecting every moment to be whipped until I could not stand: and  blessed be God  that he turned their hearts before they arrived at the place of destination: for on arriving there I was acquitted. God delivered me from the the power of the adversary. Blessed be his name, he heard my prayer in the hour of adversity, and delivered me from the enemy. I will here inform my readers, that in the time of going down to the stable, I did not make a feeble attempt to induce my master not to flog me; but put my trust, and offered my prayers to my heavenly father, who heard and answered them.            On my arriving at the stable, I was surprised to hear my master express himself in terms that I could not reasonably from former treatment expect. He said to me,  go, behave yourself well and you shall not be whipped.  In the mean      
     PREFACE.            In appearing before the public with this brief Narrative, it becomes me, as a duty, to place before that public, some of the principal reasons, which induced me to the writing of it. It is a custom, now-a-days, on assuming the station of an author, to make an obeisance to those, whom the individual looks upon as private and personal friends; and acting under this impulse, I respectfully doff the cap to  all,  and salute them with a few stray leaves from the Diary of my travels through the Southern States, with the Slave Traders.            When first induced to pen this short narrative, I was but a mere boy--a slave--untutored, and alone in the world, save some few friends, who stood by me through  thick and thin.  But from my infancy, I have been led on by degrees from step to step, by a supernatural Power--its voice has ever been with me--and each and every promise which has been made by it, has invariably been fulfilled. Many may smile in incredulity at this assertion, and consider it as a hallucination of the brain; or as an evidence of supercilious superstition. Well, let them--but I feel fully convinced and encouraged in that belief, from the blessings and knowledge which I daily see spread before me. Nor am I without precedence. We read in times gone by of the Spirit appearing to many of the believers in God. In the case of Mary the spirit of the Lord made manifest the birth of her son, Jesus--to the shepherds, too, were the same tidings delivered, through the voice of a spirit--the spirit also encouraged and converted Saul of Tarsus, as he wended his way on a crusade against the Christians--and even John was blest with a knowledge of the upper Heavens, through a supernatural spirit. Nor can I believe that those days have forever gone. A supernatural something has always forewarned me of approaching events, and endowed me with a knowledge, which has enabled me to weather the storms of forty years servitude and servile slavery, and to come forth from the trials with honor to myself, and honor to my nation. Nor has that spirit yet forsaken me--although an old man--some sixty years of age--it holds daily communion with me, and urges me on to deeds of sympathy and good will towards all men, whilst its sweet consolations repay          me an hundred fold, for all the trials I am doomed to undergo. God's name be praised.            I have said that I was forty years a slave. Yes, forty of the best years of my life, were passed in servile bondage to my fellow men. Yet, during that time, the body alone was prostrated in that degraded situation--the mind--the image and the best gift of God to man, was always elevated--it spurned the shackles, and soared to Heaven, where it revelled in Elysium; in blissful concert with its Creator.            Hard as was my fate, in being cast into a state of bondage, in witnessing the insult, the degradation--the  licenstiousness,  and the abuse, which the slave-traders heaped upon the unprotected slaves--yet, I stood firm--unshrinking to the commands of mortal--and centred my every thought upon a higher and a holier power. The body may be debased to purposes, at which the brute creation would shudder--it may be made an instrument in the hands of man to prosecute the most damning crimes--but the soul--the immaterial man--the thought--the mind, can never be chained. It belongs to a higher sphere, and ruled by a higher Being, in whose hands are held the whirlwind and the storm,--the existence and non-existence of all the human family. What cause had I then to fear? My heart laved in the waters of Salvation, and my Guardian Spirits stood forth as beacon lights, pointing the road to freedom and to happiness. I felt that this was the case with me, and I determined that  sink or swim,  I would persevere in obedience until the goal was won--and the joyful shout of deliverance and bliss, echoed through the valley.            Mankind should ever bow to the power which rules and sustains him. But that power is not vested in mortal hands--it is coeval with Deity itself, and will ever be exercised with rigid justice by an almighty God. Nor will he permit his creatures to suffer--for he has promised that those who put their trust in Him, shall pass the fiery ordeal of the world, unscathed, and unharmed. To Him, then, must I offer up my prayers for my safe deliverance from all the ills which  beseige  me during my pilgrimage on Earth.            To some, this may seem as a wild and  unfeasable  theory--void of common sense in a practical point of view, but it is as true, and unchangeable, as that God exists in His might and power, and will one day come to judge the world in righteousness and justice. Why should I not put my trust in God? I am now sixty years of age          and by His power alone, I have been sustained and upheld, and by His power alone, I have passed through trials and temptations at which the stoutest heart would quail. He has borne me through them all--He has raised me up friends in every part of the world in which I have sojourned, and He has brought me out purified and sanctified of the sins of the world--and all connexion with the evil one. How, then, can I turn a deaf ear to his commandments--and turn aside from the path which He has pointed out to me, wherein to go? Were an earthly friend to do this--were he to extend over me the arm of his protection, during the reign of trial and vexation--were he to shield and protect me in health and in sickness, what would be thought of me by the world, if I should turn aside, and denounce and condemn him as  a vain, inconsistent, and ambitious personage? Would they award to me the feelings of common humanity and respect? or, would they place any confidence in the sincerity of any profession I might thereafter make or endeavor to place before a discriminating public? No--most assuredly they would not. I would be looked upon as an ingrate--a wretch, whose feelings were seared in the heated cauldrons of base inhumanity, and corruption.            If the world would then look upon me thus--would treat me as a desperado of the deepest dye; what should I expect from an almighty parent who had sustained and protected me in every vicissitude of an ill-spent life? who has thrown the shadow of his protecting wings over me in health--and upheld me with His might and goodness when death overshadowed my couch, and laid the cold impress of his rigid seal almost upon my brow? What, I say, should be the feelings of a Righteous God, who had endowed me with talent--with understanding, and with a knowledge of good and evil, were I thus knowingly to transcend His commands--to turn ingrate upon His hands, and to say to Him by my actions,-- I am aware that you have been a kind and indulgent benefactor to me through life--but I feel that I am now beyond the influence of sickness, disease, or want, and I ask not your further aid?  Could I reasonably suppose that he would pass by such actions, and not stretch forth his  red, right arm  of vengeance; and smite His ungrateful and blasphemous creature to the earth? No! His vengeance most assuredly would fall upon me, and with such an effect that language would fail to draw the faintest picture of its direful consequences.                   Why then, should I cast Him aside, after all the blessings which He has bestowed upon me? No, I will not--I cannot let go my hold upon the Saviour, though the Earth should sink, and bury me in its deep and awful chasms of destruction. He has been a friend, when all others have passed me by in silence and in scorn--He has smiled upon me, when every lip has railed out against me in loud and vehement denunciations--and blessed be His name, he has supported me when all would have gloried in my downfall.            Yes, gentle reader, God has sustained me in every vicissitude in which I have been placed, and I feel well assured that He will continue to sustain me, until He gathers me home, to rest with Him in endless happiness. What, but His mighty arm could have shielded me from the many dangers through which I was compelled to pass, when in the possession of wealthy, influential and relentless slave-traders and slave-holders? What but His power could have snatched me from destruction, when angered men raved at me, and stood with fire-arms pointed at my bared bosom? and who but He could have given me power to brave my oppressors, and declare my rights, when the thong and the scourge were about to be applied to me at Natchez? None,--no, I feel that it was He alone, that thwarted them in their proposed cruelty, and saved His weak and dependant creature from their savage and infamous designs. His holy name be praised--for, He has said that throughout all time, He will protect and encourage all his children, if they will but put their trust in Him.            Nor has He alone shielded me from danger and harm. He has, I have reason to believe, endowed me, as I have before stated, with the power and faculty of foreseeing events, which were to take place in my eventful career--and instructed me as to the path in which I should travel, by which to avoid their evil tendencies. This, I have studiously endeavored to do; and if I have, in any instance transcended my instructions, I can confidently assert, that it has been an  error of the head, and not of the heart.  My liberation from bondage was promised me by my spiritual guide in the days of my youth, when the chains of slavery were first  rivetted  upon me--and the means and influences by which this happy event was to be consummated. Yes--even the year in which I was to become a free man, was made manifest to me, whilst toiling in servitude, and abject misery          for the malignant gratification of my fellow man--and it was this knowledge which supported me throughout nearly forty years of unjustifiable bondage. My heart was cheered with the blest conviction, that I was, at that period, to become my own master, and acknowledge the right of none to command or drive me in the commission of earthly acts, save the almighty Father of the human family. And my freedom was brought around in the exact manner which the Spirit had set apart for it. The stern, rigid and independent, yet, at the same time, obedient course which as a slave, I pursued towards my masters, was also, persevered in, for the express purpose of fulfilling to the letter, the commands of my Guardian. Never have I knowingly thwarted its wishes, but once--and heavy, indeed was my punishment, in the loss of a portion of my thumb, and uneasiness of mind for a long time thereafter. All its promises to me, have been rigidly fulfilled--and though the clouds of disaffection, and affliction have lowered heavily o'er my domestic concerns--yet, all, I feel assured will again be set aright in obedience with its stern commands. Man--frail, impotent man has no control over them,-- he can neither advance, nor retard them in their nature or their march--and until the hour arrives, in which the spirit is to set matters in their proper light before the world, things must still exist in the uncomfortable way in which they now are.            Reader--this little narrative, which will in its pages show you more conclusively the power which this Spirit has exerted over me during life, and the implicit obedience which I have ever yielded to its dictates--is another object brought forth at its commands. For this purpose I was endowed with an education suitable for the object allotted me--and for this purpose, I have now placed myself before the public as an author of a strange race. You may laugh in incredulity, if you please--you may hoot at the idea of man possessing the power of foretelling events, and you may term me fool, idiot, or what you choose--yet, as I have shown you before that this power was given man in former days--you may rest equally assured, that such power has been endowed me by an allwise God. The work is now before you, and though it springs from a dark and benighted source; yet your humble servant prays you will appreciate its merits in a spirit of kindness and leniency. May God bless you.           
     failed, it has not been for want of interest in your welfare. Do not weep for me; but prepare for the new duties that lie before you. I leave you all free. May we meet in a better world.  Her liberated slaves were sent away, with funds to establish them comfortably. The colored people will long bless the memory of that truly Christian woman. Soon after her death her husband preached his farewell sermon, and many tears were shed at his departure.           Several years after, he passed through our town and preached to his former congregation. In his afternoon sermon he addressed the colored people.  My friends,  said he,  it affords me great happiness to have an opportunity of speaking to you again. For two years I have been striving to do something for the colored people of my own parish; but nothing is yet accomplished. I have not even preached a sermon to them. Try to live according to the word of God, my friends. Your skin is darker than mine; but God judges men by their hearts, not by the color of their skins.  This was strange doctrine from a southern pulpit. It was very offensive to slaveholders. They said he and his wife had made fools of their slaves, and that he preached like a fool to the negroes.           I knew an old black man, whose piety and childlike trust in God were beautiful to witness. At fifty-three years old he joined the Baptist church. He had a most earnest desire to learn to read. He thought he should know how to serve God better if he could only read the Bible. He came to me, and begged me to teach him. He said he could not pay me, for he had           no money, but he would bring me nice fruit when the season for it came. I asked him if he didn't know it was contrary to law; and that slaves were whipped and imprisoned for teaching each other to read. This brought the tears into his eyes.  Don't be troubled uncle Fred,  said I.  I have no thoughts of refusing to teach you. I only told you of the law, that you might know the danger, and be on your guard.  He thought he could plan to come three times a week without its being suspected. I selected a quiet nook, where no intruder was likely to penetrate, and there I taught him his A, B, and C. Considering his age, his progress was astonishing. As soon as he could spell in two syllables he wanted to spell out words in the Bible. The happy smile that illuminated his face put joy into my heart. After spelling out a few words, he paused, and said,  Honey, it 'pears when I can read dis good book I shall be nearer to God. White man is got all de sense. He can larn easy. It ain't easy for ole black man like me. I only wants to read dis book, dat I may know how to live, den I hab no fear 'bout dying.            I tried to encourage him by speaking of the rapid progress he had made.  Hab patience, child,  he replied.  I larns slow.            I had no need of patience. His gratitude, and the happiness I imparted, were more than a recompense for all my trouble.           At the end of six months he had read through the New Testament, and could find any text in it. One day, when he had recited unusually well, I said,            Uncle Fred, how do you manage to get your lessons so well?             Lord bress you, chile,  he replied.  You nebber gibs me a lesson dat I don't pray to God to help me to understan' what I spells and what I reads. And he   does   help me, chile. Bress his holy name!            There are thousands, who, like good uncle Fred, are thirsting for the water of life; but the law forbids it, and the churches withhold it. They send the Bible to heathen abroad, and neglect the heathen at home. I am glad that missionaries go out to the dark corners of the earth; but I ask them not to overlook the dark corners at home. Talk to American slaveholders as you talk to savages in Africa. Tell   them   it is wrong to traffic in men. Tell them it is sinful to sell their own children, and atrocious to violate their own daughters. Tell them that all men are brethren, and that man has no right to shut out the light of knowledge from his brother. Tell them they are answerable to God for sealing up the Fountain of Life from souls that are thirsting for it.           There are men who would gladly undertake such missionary work as this; but, alas! their number is small. They are hated by the south, and would be driven from its soil, or dragged to prison to die, as others have been before them. The field is ripe for the harvest, and awaits the reapers. Perhaps the great grandchildren of uncle Fred may have freely imparted to them the divine treasures, which he sought by stealth, at the risk of the prison and the scourge.           Are doctors of divinity blind, or are they       
   slaves. The new comers disapproved of and freely talked about Yeager and his manner of living with a slave and raising children by her. This talk resulted in social ostracism of the Yeager family notwithstanding he was more prosperous than any of them. Yeager felt the social cut keenly and concluded to sell out and leave that part of the country. He accordingly advertised his farm and stock for sale. At this time his children were aged as follows: Louis was nine years of age, Isaac (myself) was seven, Ambrose five and Eddie was two. The sale took place. He retained the horses which were taken to the New Orleans market, leaving the family during his absence. Here we remained waiting patiently his return, till about two months thereafter, when the sheriff came and took us all to Bardstown in Nelson county, about two days journey eastward, and here we were placed in the negro pen for the night.      CHAPTER II.    THE AUCTION SALE.           The next morning, to our astonishment, a crowd gathered and took turns examining us. What it all meant we could not imagine till Louis was led out about ten o'clock, placed on the auction block and the auctioneer cried out:  How much do I hear for this nigger?  Allow me to say here, it was only the vulgar and low whites who used the term  nigger,  the better classes always spoke of us as negroes or colored folks. The auctioneer continued his cry for bids and Louis was at last sold for eight hundred dollars. By this time we had taken in the situation, and it seemed as though my mother's heart would break. Such        despair I hope I may never again witness. We children knew something terrible was being done, but were not old enough to fully understand.           Then the auctioneer called for Isaac and I was led out, the auctioneer saying,  Time is precious, gentlemen, I must sell them all before night; how much do I hear for this nigger?  We were instructed before hand that we must answer all questions put to us by  Yes, sir,  and  No, sir.  I was asked if I had ever been whipped, or sick, or had had the toothache, and similar questions to all of which I answered. He then cried for bids. The first bid was four hundred dollars. This was gradually raised until I was struck off for seven hundred dollars, and sold to William Madinglay, who came forward and said:  Come along with me, boy, you belong to me.  I said to him:  Let me go and see my mother.  He answered me crossly:  Come along with me, I will train you without your mother's help.  I was taken one side and chained to a post as though I had been a horse. I remained hitched to this post till late in the afternoon.           The next one sold was Ambrose. I could not see him, but I could hear the auctioneer crying for bids and my little four year old brother was sold for five hundred dollars to William Murphy.           The next to be set up was my mother and our little baby boy Eddie. To the cry for bids no one responded for some time and it looked for awhile that they were to escape being sold. But some one called out:  Put them up separately.  Then the cry was:  How much do I hear for the woman without the baby?  The first bid was eight hundred dollars, and this was gradually raised till she was sold for eleven hundred dollars.                 The next sale was of Eddie, my little brother whom we all loved so much, he was sold for two hundred dollars, to one John Hunter. Thus, in a very short time, our happy family was scattered, without even the privilege of saying  Good by  to each other, and never again to be seen, at least so far as I was concerned.      CHAPTER III.    MY NEW HOME.           Late in the afternoon my new master put me into a wagon and took me over very rough and hilly roads to his home about five miles distant, on a farm located on the bank of Beech Fork river. We reached this home of William Madinglay about ten o'clock at night. His wife, one child, and Peter, a slave, constituted his family, and I made one more.           On reaching the place,  Madinglay called loudly:  Peter!  This individual soon appeared, saying:  Yes, sir, Master!  He was then asked:            Have you put in feed for the horses?             Yes, sir, Master!            Turning to me he said:  Come along with me.            We went to the kitchen and  there we met his wife at the door when she asked:  What have you there, William?            His answer was:  Oh, I have a little boy here for you.             Indeed, you have a bright little fellow,  she replied.           He then said:  This is one of the Yeager niggers we saw advertised for sale at auction.             I declare he is not a very dark colored one.                   No, wife, he isn't, you see he is one of those pumpkin seed niggers from the mountains.             Oh Bill! what makes you talk that way? I think he will make a good servant.            His reply was:  I reckon he will when he gets that black snake around him a couple of times.  (He referred to the raw hide whip.)            William, I hope he will not need that at all, I don't think he is as stupid as Peter.             Oh well, Margaret, I don't mind if he is stupid, I can train him, there is nothing like the black snake for stupidness.            I had never heard such talk before, and I hung my head and began to cry when she said: Oh Bill, don't scare the boy to death, I think he will be a good boy.           Master then commanded:  Stand up there and straighten up, let your Mistress see what kind of a boy you are, she hasn't half seen you yet.            She brought a lamp from the shelf and carefully looked me over, after which she said:  Oh what a nice little lad, and what a nice suit he has on!             Oh yes, wife, up on the mountains they don't know how to work the niggers, but I will teach him how to work. The idea of a nigger with a suit on him like that! Wait till I get a suit on him, I'll show him how to work.            She then asked:  What is your name?             Isaac,  I answered.            That's a nice little name. Take off your hat, put it on the chair and sit down in the corner.            I took off my hat and coat and looked for a place to hang them, as I had been accustomed to do in our old home, but found none. I laid them on the little bundle I had with me and walked over to the corner of the        fireplace and sat on the floor. Peter came in and Master asked:  Have you got your chores all done?             Yes, sir, Master.             Did you go to the mill to-day?             Yes, sir, Master.             Did you bring a load of meal home!             Yes, sir, Master.             Is there plenty of wood at the still?             Yes, sir, Master.             Do you know if they are going to grind tomorrow?             Yes, sir, Master, dey's going to grind tomorrow.            After Master and his wife had eaten their supper, which consisted of mush and milk, she brought us a pan of the same for our supper, after which Master said:  Peter, this is a little nigger who is to help you in your work, he is green, but you must teach him.  Mistress then brought an old quilt saying:  This is a quilt for your bed tonight, you and Peter can sleep together, he will show you.            Peter also had an old quilt, we laid one down and took the other for a cover, our bed being the floor.           Oh, what a change! The sight of Peter set me nearly crazy. All he wore was a long tow shirt, a cloth cap and no shoes. It did not take him long to turn in as he had nothing to take off. I took off my shoes, socks, pants and coat, and then looked around to see what he had for a pillow and found he had none, but was curled up like a snake. I sat there for hours thinking of my mother, brothers and father until I was nearly wild with the change that had come, changed from a happy home to be used like a dog, and a pretty mean one at that. I wondered if I should ever see my people again. I little dreamed then what I afterwards learned, that my own father had brought all this change to us, that we were sold by his orders        and the three thousand three hundred dollars we were sold for went into his pockets less the expenses of the sale. He had sold his own flesh and blood. That is what American slavery made possible. That is the  Divine institution  we have heard so much about, the cornerstone of the proposed Confederacy. Is it any wonder the Southerners were defeated with such an incubus around their necks, dragging them down to a condition lower than their slaves, making them human demons! Do you wonder that when freedom came to me I preferred the maiden name of my sainted mother to the name of my father? In my ignorance of the true situation I mourned for him in common with my mother and brothers, and sat through that night bewildered, until tired nature forced me to lie down. I took my little bundle for a pillow, wrapped the quilt about me, not to sleep but rather to dream and wonder what terrible thing had happened to my dear father, as I then thought of him, to bring all this misfortune upon us. I tried to console myself with the thought that there must be some hereafter when we could all meet again sometime. The night wore away at last but I had had no rest. Then I heard the mournful voice of Master calling:  Peter, Peter, are you awake?             Yes, sir, Master.             Make the fire in the kitchen and in here.             Yes, sir, Master.             Bring Isaac, the lad, and show him what to do.             Yes, sir, Master.             Take him with you to do the chores.             Yes, sir, Master.             Peter then told me to bring some water while he split some wood for the Mistress. I asked where I would get the water.           He said:  See dat tree down dare?                  I said  Yes.            He said,  You go to dat tree, when you get dare you see nuther tree uther side dat tree, and when you get dare you'll see little grass uther side dat tree, and uther side dat grass dare is big hole and dat is whare de water is.            I went but failed to find  de big hole,  and he upbraided me, saying:  You nice nigger! can't fin dat well when it's bin dare long while, long fore I comed here and you can't fin it!            He took the pail and showed me the well. After we returned he asked:  Do you tink you can fin dat well now?            I said,  I thought I could,  and he sent me for another pailful while he carried in the wood after which we were to have something to eat.           We went into the house and Mistress asked:  Peter, have you done all the chores?             Yes, mam!  said Peter, and we then sat on the floor, Peter in one corner of the fireplace and I in the other; here we sat until Master and Mistress had finished their breakfast when she brought us our mush and milk once more.           Master then came and said,  Peter!             Yes, sir, Master.             Have you finished your breakfast?             Yes, sir, Master.             Go and hitch up the mules and bring them ready to put on the grists for the mill.  We obeyed and the mules were loaded with three sacks of corn on each except two that carried only two sacks each, these last were to be ridden and the others were to be led.            CHAPTER IV.    AT HOME WITH MISTRESS.           Master and Peter went with the mules and I was left to help Mistress do the washing. I was pleased with this arrangement as I liked her better than the Master. She, wishing to learn my skill as a washer, gave me first the baby's soiled clothes, these I cleaned to her satisfaction; she then gave me Master's clothes which I also washed and then she gave me her own clothes, all of which pleased her. She then asked if I could iron? I told her I would try. The clothes were dried and brought in and I ironed all of them. She was kind to me and  complimented  my work saying:  You have done very well, my boy, and now you may sit down and rest.            I sat down, but not to rest. The moment I stopped working a great grief came to me so overpowering I could not conceal my feelings and I began to cry.  She asked me kindly:  What is the matter, Isaac?  I told her,  I wanted to see my mamma.            She tried to pacify me by saying:  Don't cry and fret about that, Isaac, you will see your mother again, Master will buy her and the rest of them sometime.            I asked:  Why didn't he buy them when he bought me?            She replied:  My boy, never mind about that, your mother will be sold again soon and you will be together once more.            I asked:  Who bought her?            Her reply was:  Never mind who bought her, you must not ask questions about such things, not a question, my word is law.            Soon thereafter Master and Peter returned; on entering the house Master asked:  Well, Margaret, how did you get along with the lad?                  She informed him that I had done nicely and that I was a good little worker. His next inquiry was:  Have you taught him how to talk?             No,  she replied,  but he'll learn without any trouble.             That's the next thing he must learn,  he said and then he called in a loud commanding tone:  Isaac, come here!             All right,  I answered.           In an angry voice he said:  All right? is that the way you answer your Master? When I tell you to 'come here' I want you to say, 'Yes, sir, Master,' Now I'll try you once more; Isaac, come here.            I was frightened and again said,  All right.            He was angry. He took up the whip and said:  Isaac, you nigger you, if you don't talk to me as you ought to I shall use this black snake on you. When I call you, you must say, 'yes, sir, Master,' and to your Mistress you must say, 'yes, Madam,' and don't you ever let me hear you say 'all right' to a white man, and when you meet a white man always take off your hat and say 'yes, sir,' or 'no, sir,' and stand to one side till he passes. Remember what I have told you or I shall try the black snake on your back. Now go and help Peter do the chores.            I went, but you can imagine with what a heavy heart. Had it not been for the hope of again seeing my mother and brothers, I would gladly have laid down to die. Why should I be treated in this way; and still this was but the beginning of my new experiences. I helped Peter about the barn, after which we returned to the house for supper. We were allowed only two meals a day and mush and milk were not very lasting. After supper, which was about 5:30 o'clock, Peter and I were sent to the corn crib to shell        corn which was done by beating the ears with sticks very much the shape of hockey clubs. We were required to work at this till about ten o'clock at night during the winter, as long as the corn lasted.           As soon as spring came we were employed in cultivating the land, plowing, sowing, planting and hoeing. During this season of the year new hands were brought in every few days. One of these new hands was called  Jim.  A few days later there were among those brought in a woman and her child, she was  Amelia,  and her child was called  Lucy.            After the regular work was finished on the farm we were then set to clearing new land. Amelia was the cook and she had been there but a short time when she and the Mistress fell out. Amelia, to get even with the Mistress, put turpentine in the breakfast food, thinking it would poison the family; it didn't, however, but it made us all sick. The next day two men came and took Amelia away and left her child. What became of her we never knew but her child was sent to a neighbor's. In a few days Master purchased another woman to take the place of Amelia, by the name of Anna, and harvesting the various crops commenced.      CHAPTER V.    HIRED OUT.           The harvesting was finally all done and the first day of January, 1853, had arrived. The first of January was the time when local sales and hiring took place. Myself, Jim and Peter were among those to be hired out and we were taken to Bardstown for this purpose. Our services for the year were sold at auction. Jim was sold for the year for $150, Peter for $125 and I        was sold for $100. The cook, Anna, was taken along and sold outright to the slave dealers, and that was the last we knew of her. Peter and Jim were hired by one Miller, a farmer on the Columbia river, and I was hired to one Yates, a store keeper in Hart county. His store was near the Mammoth cave, around which at that time was a wilderness. His family consisted of himself, his wife, two sons, a woman slave and myself. My work was to do the chores about the house and run on errands to the store, which was about a mile distant. I had a fairly easy time here, my hardest work being to carry water from the cave to the house, the distance being about a mile. I had a yoke which laid across my shoulders, at each end were hooks so I could carry two pails at once. To get the water I had to enter the cave and descend about thirty feet. I was always afraid when I entered the cave because people told all manner of stories about it, saying that there were all kinds of devils and animals living in there who just delighted in catching colored people and killing them.           I managed, so far as I could, to go to the cave when the sun was shining bright so that I could see my way clearly to run if a devil appeared. The two sons of the Master were very mischievous, and when they learned how afraid I was they would go each Sunday and build a fire inside the cave and then send me for water. When I entered the cave and saw the fire I was sure it was the devil, and would run screaming at the top of my voice much to their amusement. They would then go back with me and enter the cave, by which time the fire would be out, and they would then accuse me of lying about seeing the devil. This occurred so often that Master became suspicious. He asked why it was the devils only appeared on Sundays.     
       LIFE OF  FRIDAY JONES.            My first remembrance of my life begins when I was from 8 to 10 years of age. I was born in North Carolina in 1810, the property of Olser Hye, within 15 miles of the capital of the State-- Raleigh. My mother's name was Cherry and my father's, Barney. I was taken away from them when I was small and hired out to Sim Alfred, who lived about two miles from where I was born. My mother was traded for a tract of land and sent to Alabama. My father died about this time. Just at this time I was brought to know right from wrong. I was afraid to plough in the corn-field by myself--always used to working with a large force of hands before that. I promised then and there that if I lived to be a man I would get religion. It occurred to me that if I had religion I would not be afraid of dying. When I was a boy, whichever way I turned it looked as though something was going to catch me. Though I was but a small boy I promised that I would not live the life my father had lived. I knew my father was a desperate wicked man, would get drunk. His associates were all wicked. My poor dear mother, I could not say anything about her religion but she taught me how to pray before she left me. The morning she left I could not bear to shake her hand and bid her good bye. I heard from her. She was the mother of eleven [11] children. She left four little ones of us. I was the oldest one of the four, being only about 10 years of age myself, father dead, and mother gone to the State of Alabama. It has  been over 60 years since she left us, and I have never forgotten my  mother; have no remembrance of ever having heard from her since. I promised God I would seek my soul's salvation when I got to be a man, and often refreshed my memory that I had promised Him never to live the life of my father. My conscience spoke to me and said I  thought you promised never to live the life of your father. You are  living the very same life he lived. It startled me and I looked up and cast my eyes towards the Heaven. I had to go out and fall on my face, and prayed to Almighty God. He held me to my promises and pledge until I was a man. You see at once reader how awful it is to sin against God. I was a poor ignorant boy. God had  enlitghtened  me at that day and supported me down to this day. Young man, young woman, if you have a wicked mother or a wicked father do not pursue the course that they do. Better young men to let your father go down to destruction than for you both to go.           Better young woman to let your mother go down to destruction than to let you both go. Young man if the Lord plants the seed of grace in your heart save your father through prayer if possible. Better young woman if the Lord plants the seed of grace in your heart to try and save your mother through the power of your prayers. The Lord made impression on my heart and has since completed the confession in my soul. During the dark times of slavery, ignorant as I was, He called me, and I have believed on Him ever since. No young man or woman has any excuse for sinning against God. If God enlightened me at that day and time what ought you to do with all the advantages you have now. God requires all at your hands.             He requires you to seek Him early while He may be found. That was His language to me sixty years ago. Every young man and boy, God has His eye fixed on you and is warning you every day. Every young woman and girl, God has his eye fixed on you warning you every day. Little boys and girls, God has His eye on you. He is bringing warning to your ears. He intends that none of you shall die with any excuse for not seeking Him. The first text I ever remember in my life was about the rich man and Lazarus. When I was a boy I didn't know a text. God put it in my heart to believe that text. The first minister I ever knew belonged to the Baptist denomination, (colored) his name was Stephen Southerlin. The next was a white minister belonging to the Methodist denomination by the name of David Fowler. Over 60 years since I heard them preach, and they were the first I ever heard. God put it in my heart to believe the Gospel. His spirit has forever found me. Second text was :  It shall be well with the righteous, for they shall receive the works of their hands.  The next text was:  They that have pity on the poor lendeth to the Lord.  In my fancy God had me to believe in this. I say to you young men and young women He is speaking to you as He spoke to me. God lets no man live or die with any excuse. Not knowing his will, he teaches us, through our forefathers' sins, that we are guilty rebels in His sight. I was taught that John said prepare Ye, for the kingdom of God is at hand. If God taught us in that day and time, how much more does he teach you now, that I did not know.             If He held me responsible then,  dose  He not hold you so to-day? He is a just God, He deals with all his people alike. He that will come shall come. He has made rich promises for us all. Taught me from a small boy. He is teaching me to day. I ask you young people to remember one thing, do not follow your wicked parents;  act, act  wise. Go to the Lord while you are young; while you may, as when I came to be a man grown, I was not ready then. I made many attempts to bow and pray to God, but failed to be in earnest. His spirit followed so long I had to give up my work and bow and pray. On one occasion I went out and tried to pray to God and raised up and felt worse than I did before. I bowed down, the Lord spoke to me and said, never can you obtain religion while you continue drinking whiskey. This was in 1851. I then ceased to drink, the devil got with me, told me it was all imagination and that I could take whiskey moderately two or three times a day and seek my salvation too. I did not know it was He at that time, but I yielded to           Him. I turned to and drank again as usual. In 1853 I was living in the little town of Lamberton, Robertson Co., N.C., near the line of South Carolina, when the greatest revival broke out that I had ever seen, at a Methodist quarterly meeting, during the months of June and July. The people were going up and confessing their religion by scores [.]  God's spirit had been following me until that meeting. I thought at that revival I would seek my soul's salvation. At the revival, Peter Doubt, from Raleigh, preached a sermon. So Martin, of Franklin, preached a sermon. He had formerly been a circuit rider, and was now stationed in Lamberton, they said ruin this revival and the year 1853 will roll some of you into eternity. You may never have another opportunity. Ones' text  Bring my  sipirit  away from Ephriham for he is joined to his idols again.  Ones' text was,  Go your way, Saul,  says Felix,  and come at a more convenient season and I will hear thee,  and during that revival I felt that I was a lost man. I had been so; I felt like this before. But at this revival I could not feel. I attempted to pray, but could'nt pray. I sat then and found out it was all for nothing, it seemed to me the whole of the subject seemed for me. I was the guilty man. The whole of the argument was that God never let His spirit go back to Ephriham again, but left him there and gave him up to be lost and damned forever. Felix never saw Paul again to talk with him, and that was me; both cases seemed to suit me exactly.             On one occasion during the revival I stood up and shed tears like a child; I felt my sins and asked God to forgive me and I would never sin any more--I thought I was a lost man. I went or for weeks, crying and howling to God, going on that I was a lost man. This was in 1853. I attempted to pray and could not. I would up and go, lie down by a place, get up and try it again; no relief for me yet. I would go out during the dark hours of the night, away in a lonesome place to pray. I asked God if he had drawn His spirit away from me and left me to be damned, to show it to me. He manifested that He had not drawn His Holy Spirit from me. You could hear me cry aloud, I was so rejoiced that I could be saved.             In 1854 I professed religion at my work in the woods. I forget the day of the month. In November, 1855, I was baptized ; many sore trials from June 1853 to 1855. They attempted to whip me in 1854 and backed me down but I continued to pray night and day. A  company of men hired me that year--gave Dr. Rogers $300 for me a year. When they did this, I looked at them wistfully, and when they talked of whipping me, I told them to back me down and get their shooting works ready and kill or cripple me and pay for me, for I did not let Dr. Rogers whip me and would not let anyone else do it. I went home to him on or about, the 4th of July, and told him I wanted to leave and must leave. He said that it was a good note, and for me to and stay the year out, as he did not want to take his note in. I answered him and said if he did not want to take his note in I was man enough to take care of myself.             I went back a few days after the 4th of July, but before this time I had professed a hope. I do this to show to men that no devil has the power to keep a man from praying if he is in earnest. In     
    did, and that I could pray God to forgive him, too, and  make him a good man. He asked me if I could tell  my master of the change in my feelings. I told him I  should  tell him in the morning.  And what,  he said    will you do if he whips you still for praying and  going to meeting?  I said I will ask Jesus to help  me to bear the pain, and to forgive my master for being  so wicked. He then said,  Well, then, Brother  Jones, I believe that you are a Christian.           A good many of us went from the meeting to a  brother's cabin, where we began to express our joy in  happy songs. The palace of General Dudley was only  a little way off, and he soon sent over a slave with  orders to stop our noise, or he would send the patrolers  upon us. We then stopped our singing and spent the  remainder of the night in talking, rejoicing and praying.  It was a night of very great happiness to me.  The contrast between my feelings then, and for many  weeks previous, was very great. Now, all was bright  and joyous in my relations towards my precious Saviour.  I felt certain that Jesus was my Saviour, and in this  blessed assurance a flood of glory and joy filled my  happy soul. But this sweet night passed away, and,  as the morning came, I felt that I must go home, and  bear the  slave's heavy  cross. I went, and told my mistress  the blessed change in my feelings. She promised  me what aid she could give me with my master, and  enjoined upon me to be patient and very faithful to his  interest, and, in this way, I should at length wear out  his opposition to my praying and going to meeting.          I went down to the store in a very happy state of  mind. I told James my feelings. He called me a  fool, and said master would be sure to whip me. I  told him I hoped I should be able to bear it, and to forgive  master for his cruelty to me. Master came down,  talked with me a while, and told me he should whip me  because I had disobeyed him in staying out all night.  He had told me he should whip me if ever I did so, and  he should make every promise good. So I began to  take off my clothes. He called me a crazy fool, and         told me to keep my clothes on till he told me take them  off. He whipped me over my jacket; but I enjoyed so  much peace of mind that I scarcely felt the cow-hide.  This was the last whipping that Mr. Jones inflicted  upon me.          I was then nearly eighteen years old. I waited and  begged for a paper to join the church six months before  I could get it. But all this time I was cheerful, as far  as a slave can be, and very earnest to do all I could do  for my master and mistress. I was resolved to convince  them that I was happier and better for being a Christian;  and my master at last acknowledged that he could  not find any fault with my conduct, and that it was impossible  to find a more faithful slave than I was to him.  And so, at last, he gave me a paper to Ben English,the  leader of the colored members, and I joined the love  feast, and was taken into the church on trial for six  months. I was put into Billy Cochrane's class. At  the expiration of six months, I was received into the  Church in full fellowship, Quaker Davis'class. I remained  there three years. My master was much kinder  after this time than he had ever been before; and I was  allowed some more time to myself than I had been before.  I pursued my studies as far as I could, but I soon  found the utter impossibility of carrying on my studies  as I wished to do. I was a slave, and all avenues to  real improvement I found guarded with jealous care and  cruel tenacity against the despised and desolated bondman.          I still felt a longing desire to improve, to be free, but  the conviction was getting hold of my soul that I was  only struggling in vain when seeking to elevate myself  into a manly and happy position. And now my mind  was fast sinking into despair. I could read and write,  and often enjoyed much happiness in poring over the  very few books I could obtain; and especially, at times,  I found great peace in reading my old worn Testament.  But I wanted now that hope which had filled my mind  with such joy when I first began to learn to read. I  found much happiness in prayer. But here, also, my         mind labored in sadness and darkness much of the time.  I read in my Testament that Jesus came from the bright  heaven of his glory into this selfish and cruel world to  seek and to save the lost. I read and pondered with  deep earnestness on the blessed rule of heavenly love  which Jesus declared to be the whole of man's duty to  his fellow: each to treat his brother as he would be  treated. I thought of the command given to the followers  of the loving Savior, to teach all nations to obey  the blessed precepts of the gospel. I considered that  eighteen hundred years had gone by since Jesus plead  for man's redemption and salvation, and, going up to  heaven, had left His work of mercy to be finished by  His children, and then I thought that I and thousands  of my brothers and sisters, loving the Lord and pressing  on to a blessed and endless home in His presence, were  slaves -- branded, whipped, chained; deeply, hopelessly  degraded, -- thus degraded and outraged, too, in a land  of Bibles and Sabbaths and Churches, and by professed  followers of the Lord of Love. And often, such  thoughts were too much for me. In an agony of despair,  I have at times given up prayer and hope together,  believing that my master's words were true, that  religion  is a cursed mockery, and the Bible a lie.  May  God forgive me for doubting, at such times, His justice  and love. There was but one thing that saved me from  going at once and fully into dark infidelity, when such  agony assailed my bleeding heart, -- the memory of season's  of unspeakable joy in prayer, when Love and  Faith were strong in my heart. The sweet remembrance  of these dear hours would draw me back to Jesus  and to peace in his mercy. Oh that all true Christians  knew just how the slave feels in view of the religion  of this country, by whose sanction men and women are bound, branded, bought and sold!          About this time my master was taken sick. On Sunday  he was prostrated by mortal pains; and, on Friday  the same week he died. He left fifteen slaves; I was  purchased by Owen Holmes for $435. I was then in  my twenty-third year. I had just passed through the          darkest season of despairing agony that I had yet  known. This came upon me in consequence of the visit,  which I have already described, to my dear old desolate  home. About this time, too, I entered on a new  and distinct period of life, which I will unfold in another  chapter. I will close this period of sorrow and  shame with a few lines of touching interest to my mind.    Who shall avenge the slave? I stood and cried;  The earth, the earth, the echoing sea replied.  I turned me to the ocean, but each wave  Declined to be the avenger of the slave.  Who  shall  avenge the slave? my species cried;  The winds, the flood, the lightnings of the sky.  I turned to these, from them one echo ran,  The  right  avenger of the slave is man.  Man was my fellow; in  his  sight I stood,   Wept and besought him by the voice of blood.  Sternly he looked, as proud on earth he trod,  Then said, the avenger of the slave is  GOD.   I looked in prayer towards Heaven, a while 'twas still,  And then methought, God's voice replied, I  WILL.      CHAPTER  SECOND.            I enter  now upon a new development of wrongs and  woes which I, as a slave, was called to undergo. I  must go back some two or three years from the time  when my master died, and I was sold to Owen Holmes.The bitterness of persecution which master Jones had  kept up against me so long, because I would try to  serve the Lord, had passed away. I was permitted to  pray and go to our meetings without molestation. My  master laid aside his terrible severity towards me. By  his treatment to me afterwards, he  seemed  to feel that  he had done wrong in scourging me as he had done,  because I could not obey his wicked command, to stop  praying, and keep away from the meetings. For, after  the time of my joining the Church, he allowed me to  go to all the meetings, and granted me many other little  favors, which I had never before received from him.  About this time I began to feel very lonely. I wanted       
      I felt that it all applied most sweetly to my condition, and I said in my heart, I will come now to Jesus, and trust in him. So when those who felt anxious were requested to come forward and kneel within the altar for prayer, I came and knelt down. While Jacob Cammon was praying for me, and for those who knelt by my side, my burden of sorrow, which had so long weighed me down, was removed. I felt the glory of God's love warming my heart, and making me very happy, I shouted aloud for joy, and tried to tell all my poor slave brothers and sisters, who were in the house, what a dear Saviour I had found, and how happy I felt in his precious love. Binney Pennison asked me if I could forgive my master. I told him I could, and did, and that I could pray God to forgive him, too, and make him a good man. He asked me if I could tell my master of the change in my feelings. I told him I should tell him in the morning.  And what,  he asked,  will you do if he whips you still for praying and going to meeting ?  I said I will ask Jesus to help me bear the pain, and to forgive my master for being so wicked. He then said,   Well, then, Brother Jones, I believe that you are a Christian.              A good many of us went from the meeting to a brother's cabin, where we began to express our joy in happy songs. The palace of General Dudley was only a little way off, and he soon sent over a slave with orders to stop our noise, or he would send the patrolers upon us. We then stopped our singing, and spent the remainder of the night in talking, rejoicing, and praying. It was a night of very great happiness to me. The contrast between my feelings then, and for many weeks previous, was very great. Now all was bright and joyous in my relations towards my precious Saviour. I felt certain that Jesus was my Saviour, and in this blessed assurance, a flood of glory and joy filled my happy soul. But this sweet night passed away, and, as the morning came, I felt that I must go home, and bear the slave's heavy cross. I went and told my mistress the blessed change in my feelings. She promised me what aid she could give with my master, and enjoined upon me to be patient and very faithful to his interest, and, in this way, I should at length wear out his  opposiition  to my praying and going to meeting.             I went down to the store in a very happy state of mind. I told James my feelings.  He called me a fool, and said master would be sure to whip me. I told him I hoped I should be able to bear it, and to forgive master for his cruelty to me. Master came down, talked with me a while, and told me that he should whip me because I had disobeyed him in staying out all night. He had told me he should whip me if ever I did so, and he     
         O, let us find the ancient way         GEORGIA BAPTISTS.             The following is an extract from a letter addressed to the  New York Examiner  by a clergyman of the Baptist Church in the State of Georgia. It was clipped from a Philadelphia daily paper of January, 1857:--              We, Baptists of the South, have no hesitation in avowing our belief that God 'hath made of one blood all nations.' We maintain, whether against 'politicians or infidels, philosophers or fanatics,' that the negro is a man. Because we believe this, we preach the Gospel to the negro at home; and we send the missionary to Africa to preach to him there. We witness the effect of a preached Gospel in the conversion of the negro; and when converted, the negro is as gladly welcomed into our churches as a brother, as if he were of pure Anglo-Saxon blood. Not more than a mile from where I now write, stands an humble building erected for the worship of God. Among the people who worship there, more than a hundred negroes were baptized during last year. The church now numbers two hundred and eighty-five members, of whom two hundred and twenty-eight are colored. By invitation of the pastor, I preached           there Sunday before last. Two-thirds of the congregation were negroes, and, as I proclaimed the truth, 'Ye are bought with a price,' their streaming eyes witnessed that there was a common tie of brotherhood felt and recognized between the preacher and the people, without regard to color. Not many months ago, it was my privilege, as pastor of a Baptist church, to preside in conference, when two women presented themselves as candidates for admission. They took seats on the same bench. One was a lady of wealth, intelligence, and high social position; the other a negro servant. They related their experiences. No difference could be perceived in the cordiality of the vote by which they were received. The next morning I baptized them both in the same running stream. We then repaired to the church. In the beginning of the service, in the presence of an unusually large congregation, the newly baptized took a stand together in front of the pulpit, and were addressed by the pastor in the same words of warning, exhortation, encouragement, and confidence. Then, while we sang a hymn, the members of the church, white and colored, bond and free, came forward and gave the right hand of fellowship to the new sisters. Among them, servants gave the hand to their mistress; yet was not that mistress (well though we knew her future zeal and usefulness) more sincerely welcomed as a sister in the church than the humble servant who stood by her side.              Well done, my Baptist brother! So far, so good. The Baptists of Georgia, in some respects,     
  compelled to go to work before daylight. But in spite of all   this cruel treatment they would pray and sing so that it would   disturb their old masters so that they could not sleep and they   would whip them, but still the poor slaves would continue to   serve the Lord.          Our subject said that one of the masters in that part of   Kentucky, a cruel slave holder whose name we can not recall,   had a slave (a man) by  the name of Dick, who was a true man   of God. His master was so bitterly opposed to his serving the   Lord as not to even permit him to return thanks at the table   before taking his meals. But Dick had settled the matter, and   the more his master would punish him the more he would pray   for his master.  At length his prevailing prayer with his God   was the salvation of his master, and he was converted in a   wonderful manner at a camp meeting.  Dick was present, and   his master ran to him, threw his arms around him and took   him up and carried him around in the camp ground. After his    conversion he set Dick free, and, giving him a horse, saddle   and bridle, told  him to go and preach the gospel everywhere.   He also set free all the rest of  his slaves. Oh, it is wonderful how God can use a man. This is true           CHAPTER  IV.               Our subject's  associations were mostly among the old  Christians, and her Christian life was far in advance of many  of her elders. So much was this the case that some of the  older Christians would tell her that she could live in that  happy state of mind. She thought this very strange talk for  the elder Christians to tell to young converts, but it was her  delight to serve the Lord. In her younger days she would work  hard all day in the field with the rest of the field hands, and  then would walk to a prayer meeting, should there chance to  be one anywhere in the neighborhood. Frequently she would  walk a distance of two or three miles. This song was her inspiring  hope:                                        Oh, how happy are they who their Savior obey,                                               And have laid up their treasures above.                                      Tongue can never express the sweet comfort and peace                                                Of the soul in its earliest love.                                      That sweet comfort was mine when the favor divine                                                I first found in the blood of the Lamb.                                      When my heart first believed, what a joy I received,                                                What a heaven in Jesus' name.                                      Jesus all the day long was my joy and my song,                                                Oh, that all His salvation might see.                                      He hath loved me, I cried, He has suffered and died,                                                To redeem even rebels like me.                 Her life was a life of joy in serving the Lord. Her mistress,  who, as before stated, was an old maid, and very kind to  her slaves. It was the custom among slave owners to hire a  poor white man as overseer. Most all overseers were very cruel  to the slaves in their charge. Our subject's mistress always  had an overseer, but did not allow him to treat her slaves illy,  so they were favored in the way of kind treatment above all  the other slaves in the neighborhood in which she lived. Also  some of the slaves might have had somewhat of an education  had they wanted it, but not knowing that they ever would be  free failed to take advantage of the opportunity. As slaves,  they did not need an education. Slaves in those days did not  know the words in a book, but they did know how to serve the  Lord. Our subject's trial was as a Christian. Her mother was  sick most of the time, and her mistress finally became impatient  and offered her for sale to her father for the sum of  fifty dollars. But he would not buy her, as he said he could  have no use for slaves subject to ill health all the time. But  had she been a healthy woman this man could not have  bought her for less than five or six hundred dollars. Slave  women always sold as high in price as men. Good able bodied  slaves never sold for less than from six to nine hundred dollars.  A good carpenter, blacksmith or bricklayer always sold for  from one thousand to fifteen hundred dollars. The reader will  have an idea from this how those poor human beings were  bought and sold as horses and cattle.          Her mother had another very severe attack of sickness,  worse than she had ever had, and the doctors said she must  die. She was now under a very heavy burden. The thought  that her mother might die without being consecrated brought         her faith to a severe test, as she was only a young Christian. In these hours of trouble and bewilderment she called upon  the Lord, as Jacob did in the days of old. She wrestled in  prayer and expressed her thoughts to God for the salvation of  her mother. Her prayers were answered. Her mother became  suddenly converted and lived a long time afterward. She  finally died triumphant in the faith of Christ and went home  to glory. It was a very great trial for her to see her mother die and leave all of them behind. The youngest child was only  three years old, but the dear Lord gave her grace to bear up  under her burdens, all for His name's sake, for we know that  He does all things for the best.          Her mother then being gone, all the responsibilities of the  family fell upon her, as her father did not live on the same  plantation with them. He only came home once a week, so  that not much of the family cares could rest upon him. She  had to fill the place in the household which her mother had  occupied, as her sister did not take much interest in the care  of the children. She was the only one in the family who was  a Christian. From this she learned much about the strong  arm of the Lord, who has promised to be with us six hours,  and in the seventh He will not forsake us. Oh, how we ought  to praise God for His wonderful saving grace.       
      pair shoes, one pair stockings, one pair woolen pants, one coat, two pairs coarse tow linen pants, two shirts, and board, is the law of the State of Maryland allows a man, free or slave, black or white, who hires for one year.             My friends who may read this little work, will make due allowance when they see that I never possessed the advantage of one day's schooling in my life, and only commenced to learn my letters when nineteen years and eight months old.             At one time, when going to my work, I found a piece of a chapter of an old Bible, Genesis 25, concerning Isaac, Jacob, and Esau. At this time there was an old colored man working for my father. He, taking the piece of Bible, and read it to me; I do not remember ever hearing that much of the Bible read before. I told him I would like to learn to read; he told me to get a book and he would learn me, while he stayed with us. I bought a little           primer, and Sunday morning he commenced learning me my letters. By Monday morning I could say them all. He would give me lessons nights and Sabbath mornings. He said when he used to take his master's children to school, he would carry his book in his hat and get the children to give him a lesson in the interval of the school. He grew up to be a young man, experienced religion, and joined the M. E. church, and was authorized to preach among his colored brethren, free and slave, and was set free some time before he worked for my father.             After he left our house I was without a teacher, and there was an old man about seventy-five or eighty years old, a slaveholder, owned a small farm and one slave woman married to a slave belonging to another slaveholder. This woman was the mother of two small children. Her old master had five daughters, one son eighteen years of age, a family of ten     
      that's the way ye all shout at the camp-ground. Shout away! you're gittin' happy now.              He beat her there, mockin' the while her cries of pain, till she became too much exhausted to utter another sound; and then, untying her, he delivered her to her mistress.  Thar, ma'am,  said he,  she ain't got use for no more this time. She's got the devil in her, but I reckon he'll keep still till she gits over this ere.              Much religious excitement existed at this time among the slaves in the neighborhood, and particularly upon the plantation of Mr. McKiernan. An old Baptist preacher, named Archie Eggleston, had been hired here the preceding year; and he had zealously preached to his brethren in bonds the love and compassion of Jesus; and had sought, in his simple way, to encourage them to hope for a home among  the spirits bright.  His language, it is true, was full of the quaint idioms of his race; but it spoke to the hearts of his unlearned auditory; for the little which he could tell them of the blessed Saviour was just what they loved to hear. They  received the word with gladness,  and, with its warm and cheering rays, it illumined their darkness, and strewed the thorny path they trod, not with the roses of content, but with the trembling violets of hope.             Sweet, when their daily toil was done, was the hour which, borrowed from their needed rest, they spent alone in prayer; and, as the breath of their humble souls ascended on the soft air of evening, their trusting hearts were filled with heavenly consolations.      
      think they never agreed upon the question of having slaves.  She did not like the idea of owning slaves. She was a good  Christian woman and she believed the Bible did not teach  that it was right to own slaves. Shortly before her death  an incident occurred which made a very great impression upon  all of us for more reasons than one. She was very sick and  one day she called Frank, the carpenter, and who as the head  slave had charge of the others, and told him to bring into  her room all the slaves he could find on the plantation. They  were shelling corn at the time, getting it ready to ship to  the market, and he brought in as many as he could get  together, I suppose, in a short time. I was not one of them,  but I was later told by the others what happened. She said  to them,  Be good and do your work and the time will come  when you will all be free. The North is not satisfied with  slavery.  My master's brother was present and heard this and  after that we were treated very much worse than before.  Whenever they saw a group of us standing together they would  come up and make us disperse for fear we were going to raise  against them. Shortly after that our mistress died and on  the day of the funeral all of us slaves on the plantation,  between seventy-five and a hundred, men, women and children,  followed her body to the cemetery, about five miles away,  where she was buried.             It was a very sad occasion, for all the women were crying and  most of the men too, as well as the children. We knew that  she was the best friend we had and that now our lot would be  harder. Shortly after that my master married again, but our  new mistress did not have the kind heart our old mistress  had had.             I do not remember just the year our mistress died and told us  that we would some time be free, but I think it was about  1858. At any rate, it was not long before we began to hear  talk of a war. Our masters were afraid that there would be  a war. They kept talking against the North. They told us that  the white people in the North were nothing but shop slaves.  That the white girls were slaves who did the house work for  the Northern people and that the Northern people were not  considered as high class people as the Southern people. It  was about this time, too, that we first heard of a man named  Lincoln. They said he was a bad man and that he had horns.  Another man we heard about was John Brown and the underground  railroad. Of course we did not understand what the  underground railroad was. We thought it was some sort of a  road under the ground. We only knew, of course, what we were  told. We could not read or write and if any of us had tried  to learn to read or write we would have been severely  punished. One reason for the prejudice which the plantation  owners had against the poor white people in every community  was that these poor white people naturally sympathized with  us and the plantation owners were afraid that because of this  they might teach us to read or might give us some information  about what the North was trying to do. So we learned little  about the outside world. We did learn, however, that a man  named Wendell Phillips and a man named Garrison were getting  slaves into Canada and we were told that once you got into  Canada they could not get you back again, that you were free.  Of course the slaves as a whole wanted to be free. Many of  them were not treated well and the thought of being sold was  a very burdensome thing. The slaves on our plantation had  been told that they were going to be free, and they were  looking for what their mistress had said to come true. Then  Colonel Nelson, who owned an adjoining plantation, set all  his slaves free by his will when he died and they were all  sent to Liberia. There were about seventy-five of them. And  we were anxious to be free too.              I do not mean by all this that our life was altogether bad.  We had enough to eat and we had certain pleasures. It was a  common thing for the slaves to have parties where the slaves  from adjoining plantations came together and danced and sang  and played. The masters encouraged these parties for the  purpose of getting the young men and women slaves acquainted  with one another. They were looked forward to with pleasure,  for they were the chief social events.             Another thing we liked to do was attend the camp meetings. We  liked the singing and speaking. And then it was something for  us to go to. One of the worst features of slavery was that  the slaves on a plantation were virtually in prison. They  could not leave the plantation except with the            consent of their masters. Then no matter how hard they worked  they had nothing which they could call their own. Even their  children did not belong to them. And they themselves were  liable to be sold away to a distant part of the country to a  master whom they did not know and who might be very cruel to  them. Then as there were no schools for us and as we could  not read you can see how we would want to go to camp meetings  or to church. So we were always glad when Sunday came. On  Sunday, masters and slaves all went to church together.             Our master was a very religious man, being a local preacher  in the Methodist church. Once every three months the  Presiding Elder used to visit the church and hold a quarterly  meeting after he had preached. On one of those visits an  incident occurred that I still remember even after so many  years. It showed how bitter our masters were toward any one  who sympathized with us. And it marked, too, the breaking off  of religious association between our part of the South and  the North.      III             I cannot remember when the church incident with relation to  the Presiding Elder occurred, but it could not have been so  very long before the beginning of the war. We slaves used to  go to the same church our master and the other plantation  owners attended. Of course we used to sit back by the door  by ourselves while they sat up front. The church was about  five miles away from our plantation. We slaves used to walk  while our masters rode. This Sunday for some reason they  left me at home. But after they were gone I happened to  think of a donkey I often rode and the thought occurred to me  that I might ride him to church. So I got on his back and  started off. He carried me to church in good style but when  we reached there instead of waiting for me to get off he  threw me off. I had no rope to tie him, so I left him outside  and went in the church. The result was that he got in a fight  with another donkey while the church services was in progress  and created such a disturbance that I was later given a  severe whipping for it.             But another thing happened during that service which caused  a greater commotion than my donkey. Mr. Ayers, the Presiding  Elder, called upon a colored man named Ennis Dilamar to pray.  Ennis was a slave who had recently been purchased by my  master and who had quite a local reputation as a religious  man. The fact that Mr. Ayers should call upon a slave to pray  caused great offense to the plantation owners and after the  service was over and while the masters and their families  were arranging themselves on the ground to eat their dinner,  my master called Ennis to him and asked him what he meant by  asking God to send the time when Ethiopia should stretch  forth her arm like an army with banners, and said that he  would teach him better than to use such words as that. Of  course Ennis could not make any reply to this. He had simply  been repeating what he had heard some white man say, because  he himself could neither read nor write. However, they gave  him a severe whipping right then and there. This seemed to  disturb Mr. Ayers very much. He withdrew from the company and  went over to where the slaves were preparing their dinner and  told them that he did not see why a Christian man could not  be allowed to use his gift of prayer even if he was black.  In some way this remark got to the white people. So when the  afternoon meeting was called my master told Mr. Ayers that  his service was no longer wanted and that he need not visit  the church any more. From that time on my master had charge  of the meetings as local preacher and we never saw Mr. Ayers  again.             This incident, as I say, must have happened a short time  before the beginning of the war, because shortly afterwards  Samuel Hymans, a young man from our community who was  attending West Point, came home for a vacation, but when the  vacation was over he did not return to West Point. Instead  he commenced to organize a company of soldiers. I was very  anxious to go with him as his servant and my master, at his  request, let me do so. The reason why I was anxious to go  with Hymans was because I wanted to learn how to drill. I did  learn to drill. In fact I learned how to drill so well that  after a while when he was busy with other matters he would  tell me to drill the company for him. After Fort Sumpter      
      I have never had such feelings before nor since. I became so disturbed about my situation, I plead with God day and night, for my deliverance. I could heartily join the Prophet and say :  O, that my head were waters and mine eyes a fountain of tears.  For I thought I certainly would grieve and cry myself to death. The tears I shed, flowed so constantly that there were two briny channels made visible upon my cheeks. Right here I promised God, if he would interpose and deliver me from this affliction, I would be an humble, faithful and obedient servant all the days of my life. I used as a plea the power he had exercised in freeing me from sin. I knew very well, if God was able to deliver me from the corrupt influence of the world and the power of Satan, that he was able to deliver me from this slave-holder. Yet I was like many others, I did not see by what method he would secure my deliverance. Still with child-like simplicity I trusted him, though I did not understand then as I do now, the sentiment or that good hymn:     Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take,                I was advertised for sale in the Baltimore papers, and this kind of statement was made:                      No one can buy him but a Georgian.              It seemed that nothing would satisfy Mr. Burnibue's hatred and bitter feeling against me, but my shipment to Georgia. Still I waited the appointed time until my deliverer came. The Lord moved in a mysterious way, his wonders to perform. I now close this chapter and hasten to my mysterious redemption.      CHAPTER II.  MY REDEMPTION.             Miss Matilda White, unbeknown to me, had skillfully arranged to defeat Mr. John Burnibue's evil designs, and, therefore, consulted a Georgia slave-buyer and provided him with the means and instructed him to buy me for her. Her intention to set me free was kept a profound secret from Mr. Burnibue, and, also, from the Georgian; for if it had been known to either or both, the plan could not have been worked so successfully as it was, for Mr. Burnibue would not have permitted her to buy me; and, just to think, this wise and blessed woman never even hinted to me her intention to set me free. This, I regarded as a wise step in her, for if I had known it, I might have           been overjoyed and revealed her plan and might have been the means of her being defeated. I was sold at home between nine and ten o'clock in the morning (the precise date unknown). As I came down stairs from Mr. Burnibue's office (his private office) I met Miss Matilda White, and the Georgian handed her a bill of sale for me, and immediately she took me to a lawyer's office (Mr. Heath's). He wrote my free papers, and, in company with Miss Matilda White, the lawyer went to the court-house and had them recorded. This was on the day I was sold, and I received a copy of the same.             I said, now I am free--both soul and body. My heart was so rejoiced I did not know hardly what to say, yet I said,  Glory to God in the highest.  Here, with gratitude and thankfulness, I made many promises to God which, in the long line of my life, have been motives to noble enterprises for God and humanity. I consecrated myself to God and my whole life to better the condition of my people. Ever since then, the cause of the Lord has prospered in the hands of his humble servant, of which I shall speak more elaborately in the future.       His purposes will ripen fast,        
     which to appear with decency on the occasion of taking his baptismal vows, and received two dollars,--sixteen- fold more than Col. Suttle ever gave him at any one time, before or after.             At the proper time he was baptized and received into the Baptist church at Falmouth. The church consisted of white freemen and black slaves. All assembled within the same walls for worship on the Sabbath, but a partition of boards separated the bond from the free. When the Holy Supper was administered, the cup was first carefully served to all of the privileged class, and afterward to their sable brethren. Those distinctions were not maintained in anticipation of heaven, but in deference to the prejudices of Virginia society. In the social religious meetings there was a somewhat nearer approach to the New Testament model, and the prayers and exhortations of the slaves were graciously suffered to intermingle with those proceeding from the master's lips.             Among the Christian slaves at the south there is a class of persons that bear the character of quasi-pastors or preachers. Without being formally set apart to the sacred office by any rite of ordination, they yet receive a sort of recognition from the church with which they may happen to be connected. Piety, a gift at exhortation, and a desire for the work of a preacher, are the requisite qualifications. All these were found in Anthony when, at the end of two years from the period of his baptism, he applied to his brethren for their recognition      
     NARRATIVE   OF   PHEBE ANN JACOBS.  BY  MRS. T. C. UPHAM.     MY MASTER WILL TELL ME WHERE TO SIT. -- PAGE 6.                THE subject of this narrative was a coloured woman, born a slave in Morris county, New Jersey, July,  1785. At an early age she was given to Mrs. Wheelock, wife of President  Wheelock of Dartmouth college, to be an attendant on her daughter, Maria Malleville, who was afterwards  the wife of President Allen, of Bowdoin college, Brunswick, Maine.  She came to Brunswick with President Allen's family in 1820, and remained with them until the death of Mrs.  Allen, from which time she chose to live alone. She died in Brunswick, February 28, 1850.             Soon after she became a member of President Wheelock's family, Phebe was brought to see her lost state by nature, and to flee to the Saviour as her only hope and refuge. Her  subsequent life evinces that she had  clear  and  happy  views of the way of salvation by Christ.             Phebe, for the last eighteen years, supported herself by washing and ironing for the students of Bowdoin College. In her little habitation all was neatness and             order. All her work seemed to be sanctified by prayer and praise, and to be done cheerfully, heartily, as  unto the Saviour whom she loved. However busy, she was always ready to  enjoy a season of devotion with her Christian friends who called to see her. She chose to live  alone-- alone with God , where, as she expressed it,  there would be no hinderances to  prayer and praise at any time; where she could converse with her Saviour all day long.  So naturally  would she speak to us of the presence of Christ with her, so happy was she in her  testimony to the consolations she enjoyed in communion with Him, that one could not but feel that Christ was  with her, and that her little cottage on the plain was near to heaven.             Phebe was  contented and happy.  As a friend passed her dwelling, and it was  beginning to  rain, it was said to her,  I am afraid you will not get your clothes dry to-day, Phebe.    That  is as the Lord pleases,  she replied. All was right with her, because she resigned her own will to the  will of God; hence she seemed to be always peaceful and happy. Every body  knew that Phebe was  happy , and that it was  religion  that made  her so. Young persons and  children, as well as those of maturer years, loved to visit her. At one time a little coloured girl was spending  several weeks with Phebe. A gentleman meeting her, said,  Where do  you live, little girl?   With  happy Phebe ,  was her quick reply. Not  long since, a kind  neighbour sent her daughter to read to her the little book,  A Trap to catch a Sunbeam.   After hearing it, said Phebe,  That is a beautiful book, but I don't need a trap to catch sunbeams; I   find sunbeams everywhere.               Who ever heard Phebe complain, or severely censure any one? Fault-finding was not her way of doing good, or being useful in the church. When harsh remarks were made in her  presence concerning her brethren or sisters, she would say,  We must pray for them.  And this was her custom. Not long since she was rudely spoken to, and her feelings wounded.  Said Phebe,  I have a Friend, to whom I can go;  and with no other reply she turned away, and on her             knees before God prayed for this individual. The next morning the person came and asked her pardon. How beautifully  does this illustrate the passage,  Dearly beloved, avenge not  yourselves.  Again, returning home from meeting, one dark evening, with her head bowed down as usual, she was  accosted,  Where are  you  bound, old woman?   To  Canaan's happy land,   she answered.             Phebe  loved the Scriptures.  Near by her, and always on her mind and heart, was her   precious Holy Bible,  and her large-print Testament. Phebe had the same Bible that others  have, but she found in it a great deal more than is commonly found, as all may observe who have seen her Bible. There  the promises, and the threatenings and warnings too, are  marked or underscored by her pen or pencil. Phebe's marks beneath or beside a passage, made often with a heavy stroke  of her pencil, come to our minds with the force of a  commentary, for she was herself a  living epistle,   known and read  by us all. Said her  pastor,  *    If a thousand devoted Christians were requested  to mark their favourite texts and  expressions, it is believed they would hardly mark one not understood by Phebe.                  * Phebe was a Member of the Congregational Church of  America, corresponding to the  Independents in England.               Phebe  loved the house of God.  She took great delight in the services of the sanctuary: hence  she was never absent except from sickness or urgent necessity. She was indeed a pillar of the church; one in whom the  minister found support by her constant attendance and  prayers, by her cordial reception and love of the truth. She was the first to be seated in her place at church. For many years, in our former house of worship, she was seen sitting in  one corner of the gallery, on the furthest row of seats, with her head bowed in secret prayer. To look up to her as we entered the house of God was, to some of us at least, a prayer, a  sermon, a hymn of praise. The last winter, her health failing, she was unable to walk to church as formerly, and remained during the intermission--a season highly           prized by some of her Christian friends, who would hasten back to meet her. That glowing look of hers, that close pressure of the hand, that Sabbath-day greeting, will never be  forgotten. The best, the most experienced Christians loved to be with Phebe, because she was a happy, Bible Christian, a witness to the truth of God.             Phebe  loved to pray . Many times a day would she go to her bedroom, carpeted as for a little sanctuary, and kneel and pray. So much was her soul awake to the interests of Zion, it was  no uncommon occurrence for her to arise at  midnight  and pray.  At midnight I will arise, and give thanks unto Thee.  This is a marked passage in her Bible. About four years since,  her pastor was strengthened more than usual in his labors; his soul was richly fed with heavenly manna; and of this bread many of his flock partook with him. Not long after this  season of refreshing, it was ascertained that Phebe had arisen  every night, month after month, at midnight,  to pray for her pastor.             Many were the  individuals  for whom she prayed. During the past winter a friend called to see her.  What is the good word?  said Phebe.  Anna--is serious, and inquiring the way  of life.  She arose at once from her seat, lifted her hands, and with tears of joy praised God aloud, and said,  For  her  I have been praying; God is a bearer of prayer.              Phebe's  faith and confidence in God were practical,  and availed her in time of need. When her mistress, Mrs. Allen, died, whom she loved more than any being on earth, and whose  death was very sudden, in the dead of night, causing great distress in the family, Phebe calmly said,  Don't we pray, 'Thy will be done?' and now it is done.              Phebe  gave of her substance.  She made a monthly contribution of fifty cents to missions, and bequeathed her little all, remaining after her decease, to the cause of Christ.             Phebe  prayed for the college.  The officers and students she bore on her heart to God. She  always manifested a deep interest in the annual concert of            prayer for colleges. At this concert, in the year 1834, a six o'clock morning prayer-meeting was appointed. When the pastor came, he found that Phebe had been there,  on the door steps more than an hour praying!  While it was yet dark, she found her way to the  prayer-meeting, as Mary to the sepulchre. Who can tell how many souls were converted in answer to the prayers on that door-step--how much they had to do with those conversions  in college which occurred at this time, and the fruits of which may be seen in the ministers scattered abroad, preaching the gospel, gathering souls into the kingdom of Christ? Those  seasons of revivals in college, have they no connection with the prayers of this humble saint, who lived to pray: lived in obscurity, and yet lived for the college; lived for the  church; lived for the pastor; lived for the world?             Phebe  loved the church and female prayer-meeting.  Through the storm and wind and bad walking, she would find her way to the place of prayer. In the female prayer-meeting, all  loved to kneel when Phebe prayed. She approached the throne of grace as if her mind and heart were already there, and she had only to open her lips and the prayer of the heart  ascended, in humility and faith and love. The last Sabbath she spent on earth she was at church as usual, and stopped at noon, and was conversing on the value and importance of  this meeting. She then alluded to a time, about four years since, when  she could not hold her peace.  About this time Phebe seemed more fully than ever before to receive Christ as  an all-sufficient, present Saviour. The blessings of His salvation seemed as much her own, as if she alone was heir to the redemption purchased by Christ. She  knew in whom she  believed,  and that  He was able to make all grace abound toward her.  Grace was triumphant in her soul, and so continued, by her own testimony given at her last interview  with her Christian friends. From this time, as she often expressed it,  she had never let her Saviour go;   she had held Him by the hand,  nay more,  He had come into her heart, and continued             to abide with her.   Satan is busy with me,  she would sometimes say,  but my Lord is  stronger than he.   My little house,  said she,  this winter has become a  palace : while  sweeping my room to-day, I thought, I must sweep softly, for He was here, my Lord and  King.              Phebe  was humble.  Her humility drew all hearts towards her. All the attention she received did not cause her for a moment to step aside from her own humble path, in which she  continued to walk, doing her own work, or rather the Lord's, in her own humble, quiet way. She rarely, if ever, spoke first, yet was always ready to respond heartily to the greetings of  her brethren and sisters in Christ. She literally and truly sought out the  lowest seat . Down by the door at the evening meeting sat Phebe, with her head bowed, neither seeing nor  wishing to be seen. Being urged to come up nearer, as she had often been before, it was said to her,  What will you do, Phebe, when you got to heaven?   My Master will tell me where to sit,  she answered. There was a peculiar lowly attitude of spirit and manner which sat on her with a natural grace and beauty, that cannot be described.             Phebe  had no fear of death.  She died as suddenly as her mistress, and now lies by her side in the Pinegrove cemetery, where lie so many of the loved and honoured. She had often  expressed a desire to be placed at her mistress' feet. As she was expecting to die  suddenly  and  alone , she had given the signal to her nearest neighbour, that when she saw no smoke  from her chimney in the morning, she would know that she was gone.  When you hear I am gone home,  said she to the writer of this, the Sabbath before she died,  praise the  Lord.   I shall go soon, very soon. If to-morrow you hear I am gone home to heaven, rejoice and give thanks, and remember, it is well with me.   Jesus, lover of my soul,  she repeated at this, our last Sabbath interview;  yes,  lover,  LOVER, LOVER! How can I better express  it? ' Jesus, lover of my soul. '               A few hours only before she was called away, she came to look on the wife of her pastor, then sleeping             her last sleep, from which she was to awake only in heaven. As Phebe was standing and looking earnestly, and as it was believed wishfully, on that near approach to heaven, she  was asked,  Phebe, don't you wish you were going home so soon?   Yes, indeed I do,  was  her emphatic answer.  Are you not unwilling to be there alone in your house, when you may be taken sick at any time?  She replied, with solemn earnestness,  I am not alone; my  Saviour is with me: He is my keeper, my Shepherd, my All--my All in All.              The next morning Phebe's body was found in her bed, cold and lifeless, her eyes calmly closed, the mouth shut, her hands placed by her side, her candle burnt out, her Testament  and spectacles by the bedside, the door of her house unbolted; no smoke ascended from her cottage, and Phebe was not--God took her.              Who now will pray for us?  said one;  Phebe is gone.   We have lost Phebe's prayers,   said another;  what a loss!  Again,  Phebe has been praying for us all these thirty years; and now we feel that God has made a great breach upon us.  Said another,  Yes,  we  have lost, but  heaven  has gained. Who will sing the Saviour's praises louder, sweeter, than Phebe?              The Sabbath following, at the close of the afternoon  services, her remains were brought to the house of God. A large assembly were collected from all the congregations  of the village. The pastor, Rev. Dr. Adams, though in deep affliction, his companion lying dead, to be buried on the morrow, could not refuse to be  present: a highly valued member of his church had been taken from him; one on whose prayers he depended, whose encouraging words had often given him new strength; one who was a living witness of the truths he preached; an example to believers--yes, the pastor, though in tears, was present to read the hymns, to offer the prayer, to read the Scriptures, to address the assembly, to bear a testimony, a full and emphatic testimony to the worth of Phebe. His trying position and touching address; the sympathy of his flock with             him; the loss to us of his companion, a woman greatly respected and beloved; and the loss of Phebe, made this occasion one of peculiar tenderness and solemnity. Slowly and sweetly  sounded forth the organ's notes on that day, as if a weeping angel touched the strings; there was sadness and beauty in the strains.             The wife of the pastor died the same night with Phebe, and perhaps at the same hour of the night. We may think of them, as ascending together to the mansions of the blessed. To  die  with Phebe  was a privilege; and the pastor remarked on this occasion, that if his wife had been permitted to choose a companion to accompany her through the  dark valley,  and into the open portals of heaven, she would have chosen Phebe. She was heard to say,  I am  perfectly happy; Christ is sufficient for all my necessities; I never supposed I could enjoy so much: there is no one on earth I would exchange places with but Phebe.              At the funeral of Phebe there was no relative, no kindred of the flesh. Those following nearest her remains were President Allen and daughters, who, informed by telegraph, had  come nearly two hundred miles to testify their respect and affection for the deceased. Her remains were borne out from the church and accompanied to the grave by officers of the  college and others, who might have been chosen for this purpose had the most honoured and most beloved among us fallen. A long procession followed her remains and gathered  around her grave.           LONDON:    Printed for W. and F. G. Cahs,  5, Cishopsgate Without            Return to Menu 
       CHAPTER III.     RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCES.           I COME now to a phase in my experience which aroused the impressions made upon me so long before in the blackberry pasture.           At Powell's Fort, not far from where I now lived, was the Mount Asa school-house, where the different religious denominations held their meetings. My master's brother, Jerry Kibbler, and his sister Sally had been to a camp-meeting, and got  religion.  They came home determined their religion should help others; and, through their influence, this little school-house had been fitted up with pulpit and seats, and now there was to be a series of revival meetings held there. I had never been to any kind of a meeting since I was a little girl, and then my mistress had sometimes taken me along for company.           At this time, Miss Ellen Mills was spinning wool at Mr. Jonathan Grandstaff's; and one night, as it was growing dusk, she came down to master's, to see if some of the family would go to meeting with her. No one cared to go; and Miss Lucy, turning to me, said:  There is Betty. Take Betty. She will be company for you.  So I went. The minister was preaching when we entered; and I have no recollection of anything he said in his sermon, but, when he took his seat, he sang the hymn,  -           Then let this feeble body fail,              It was a hymn of many verses (I afterwards got an old woman to teach them to me); and there was such tenderness in his voice and such solemnity in his manner that I was greatly affected. When the singing was over, he moved about among the congregation; and, coming close to me, he said,  Girl, don't you want religion? don't you want to be happy when you die?  Then he asked me to promise him that, when I got home, I would go upon my knees and ask God to give me the witness that I was his. I made him no answer; but, as soon as I reached home and was alone, I knelt down, and in my feeble and ignorant way begged to be saved. From that day to this, I have been praying and trying to do as I thought my heavenly Master has required of me; and I think I have had the witness of the Spirit.           So, night after night, I went to the little school-house, and had many precious seasons. Master Jerry and Miss Sally were very kind to me, and tried to show me the way to be a Christian.           But there came a time when Master David said he was not going  to have me running to meeting all the time any longer. He had decided  to send me up to old Mr. Levers, two miles away, there to stay until  I should get over my  religious fever,  as he called it. Accordingly,  I went as directed; but, when it came night, I asked if I might go  down to Mount Asa school-house for meeting. The old         man said:  Yes. You can go; and, as it is so far away, you need not come back here till morning. But go home, and stay with the children, as you always do, and have the care of them.  I couldn't understand it, but I went; and, when in the morning Kibbler saw me, he scolded, and sent me off to Levers again. Every night, old Mr. Levers would tell me I could go; and I did, till, in the middle of the meeting one night, Master Kibbler came up to me, and, taking me by the arm, carried me out, scolding and fuming, declaring that old Webster (the minister) was a liar, and that for himself he didn't want such a  whoopin' and hollerin' religion,  and, if that was the way to heaven, he didn't  want to go there.  After this, my conscience troubled me very much about going. Mr. Levers would tell me to go; but I knew that Master David had forbidden me to do so. One night, I started out, and, as I came to a persimmon-tree, I felt moved to go down on my knees and ask the Lord to help me, and make Master David willing. In a few minutes, I felt very happy. I wanted to remain on my knees, and wished I could walk on them till I could come before Master David. I tried to do so, and was almost surprised to find I could get along so well. At last, I reached the piazza, and was able to enter the room, where I saw him sitting; and, as I did so, I said,  O Master,  may  I go to meeting?  He saw my position; and, as if  rent by the Spirit,  he cried out:  Well, I'll go to the devil if you ain't  my match!  Yes: go to meeting, and stay there.            After this, I had no trouble from this cause. When I was to be taken into the church, I asked him if he was willing, and he said:  I don't care. If that's your way of getting to heaven, I don't care. I only wish you were all there.  So I was baptized, and have been trying, in my poor way ever since to serve the Lord.      
   to talk with any one. His young master, who, although a professed minister of the gospel, gave no attention to the religious culture of his slaves--his policy being, (to use Quamino's word,) to keep them  igarent,  that they might be more serviceable--followed him, and listened as he prayed in the barn, with great fervency,-- as well,  said he,  as I could.  On his return to the house, he questioned him sharply, saying repeatedly, that to be talking thus when he was alone, he must be talking to the Evil Spirit:  but,  said our aged friend, in relating the story,  I knowed better than that. I wasn't after the Evil Spirit. I didn't want to have anything to do wid him.            From this time, Quamino understood the nature of that peace which is independent of external circumstances, being given  not as the world giveth.  On the first day of the week he would get the carriage ready, and when his master had started, he would walk several miles across the fields to meeting, and back; but, as he was certain to be faulted, and sometimes even  cuffed,  if not at home in time to take the horses, on the arrival of the family, he always left the congregation before the completion of the service.           About the age of twenty-six, he married Sarah, a slave on a neighbouring place. She was soon sold to a distance of five miles, and for some years they only met once a week. One Sabbath morning he went to see her, and found that she and her infant     
     slaves. Hence they resort to some kind of amusement. Those who make no profession of religion, resort to the woods in large numbers on that day to gamble, fight, get drunk, and break the Sabbath. This is often encouraged by slaveholders. When they wish to have a little sport of that kind, they go among the slaves and give them whiskey, to see them dance,  pat juber,  sing and play on the banjo. Then get them to wrestling, fighting, jumping, running foot races, and butting each other like sheep. This is urged on by giving them whiskey; making bets on them; laying chips on one slave's head, and daring another to tip it off with his hand; and if he tipped it off, it be called an insult, and cause a fight. Before fighting, the parties choose their seconds to stand by them while fighting; a ring or a circle is formed to fight in, and no one is allowed to enter the ring while they are fighting, but their seconds, and the white gentlemen. They are not allowed to fight a duel, nor to use weapons any kind. The blows are made by kicking, knocking, and butting with their heads; they grab each other by their ears, and jam their heads together like sheep. If they are likely to hurt each other very bad, their masters would rap them with their walking canes, and make them stop. After fighting, they make friends, shake hands, and take a dram together, and there is no more of it.             But this is all principally for want of moral instruction. This is where they have no Sabbath Schools; no one to read the Bible to them; no one to preach the gospel who is competent to expound          the Scriptures, except slaveholders. And the slaves, with but few exceptions, have no confidence at all in their preaching because they preach a pro-slavery doctrine. They say,  Servants be obedient to your masters;--and he that knoweth his masters will and doeth it not, shall be beaten with many stripes-- means that God will send them to hell, if they disobey their masters. This kind of preaching has driven thousands into infidelity. They view themselves as suffering unjustly under the lash, without friends, without protection, of law or gospel, and the green eyed monster tyranny staring them in the face. They know that they are destined to die in that wretched condition, unless they are delivered by the arm of omnipotence. And they cannot believe or trust in such a religion, as above named.             The poor and loafering class of whites, are about on a par in point of morals with the slaves at the South. They are generally ignorant, intemperate, licentious, and profane. They associate much with the slaves; are often found gambling together on the Sabbath; encouraging slaves to steal from their owners, and sell to them, corn, wheat, sheep, chickens or any thing of the kind which they can well conceal. For such offences there is no law to reach a slave but lynch law. But if both parties are caught in the act by a white person, the slave is punished with the lash, while the white man is often punished with both lynch and common law. But there is another class of poor white people in the South, who, I think would be glad to see slavery abolished in self defence; they despise the institution     
     and who, that casts his eye back through the dark, bloody track of slavery, does not perceive that the masters have acted up to their interest? We sometimes had cider; occasionally some meat and milk, as it might happen.             We remembered what our brothers told us--when we were able to run away, to try it on some favorable Sunday. The old man would let us go to meeting on Sunday at the village, but if we were not at home by sundown, the cowhide paid the debt. We were slaves yet, and the old man grew poorer and poorer the older he grew, and withal cross, much to our discomfort. He had a wife like king Herod, and like Ahab, for we read that Beelzebub stirred up Ahab to work evil in the sight of the Lord.             Finally the old lady teased her husband to put my brother Nick out; and he let him out for ten dollars a month. I was at home with two women and a boy to carry on the farm,     
    killed by the lightning. Although in the thunderstorm  alluded to Mr. Allen seemed to be alarmed; at other  times he did not appear to think seriously about such  things, for I have heard him say, that he did not think  God had anything to do with thunder and lightning.  This same official had much apparent zeal in the cause  of the sunday school; he used to pray with, and for the  children, and was indefatigable in teaching them the  catechism after him; he was very particular, however,  in not allowing them to hold the book in their own  hands. His zeal did not appear to have any higher  object than that of making the children more willing slaves; for he used frequently to tell his visitors that coloured people were never converted--that they had no  souls, and could not go to heaven, but it was his duty  to talk to them as he did! His liberality to the white  people, was co-extensive with his denunciation of the coloured race; he said a white man may do what he  pleased, and he could not be lost; he might lie, and  rob the slaves, and do anything else, provided he read  the bible and joined the church!     CHAPTER V.            It may now be proper to say a little about the state of the churches in slave countries. There was a baptist minister in the city of Richmond, whose name was John Cave. I have heard this man declare in public that he had preached six years before he was converted          and the reason of his conversion was as follows. He  was in the habit of taking his glass of mint julep  directly after prayers, or after preaching, which he thought  wonderfully refreshed his soul and body; he would  repeat the dram three or four times during the day. But an old slave of his, who had observed his practice hinted to him something about alternately drinking and preaching to the people; and, after thinking seriously on what the slave told him, he  begau  to repent, and was converted. And now; he says he is truly converted, because his conscience reproved him for having made human beings articles of traffic; but I believe his second conversion is just about as complete as his first for although he owed the second change to one of  his own slaves, and ever confessed that the first effect of his conversion, was, to open up to his conscience the evil of the traffic in human beings, instead of letting those at liberty which he had under his control--and which might  bave  been at once expected, as a natural consequence of his conviction--he endeavoured to apologize for the want of conscience, by finding, what he called, a good master for them, and selling them all to him.            But the religion of the slave-holder is everywhere a system of mere delusion, got up expressly for the purpose of deceiving the poor slaves, for everywhere the leading doctrine in the slave-holder's religion is, that it is the duty of the slave to obey his master in all things.                    When  Mr  Carr left the city he was succeeded by a  Mr.  Teter , who remained for many years; but at the  time when he commenced his ministerial duties, many  of the slaves were running away to free states; on the  learning of which Mr. Jeter's first object was to devise  some plan by which the masters could more effectively  prevent their negroes from escaping; and the result of  his ingenuity was as follows. He got the deacons and  many more of the good christians of his church, whether  to believe or not I do not know, but to hold out that the  place of meeting which they then  occupyed  was not large  enough for them; and he seemed not relish being in the same church with the negroes, but, however that was,  he managed, with the assistance of his church members,  to get the negroes all round the district to believe that  out of love for them, and from pure regard to their  spiritual interests, it had been agreed that the old meeting  house was to be given to the negroes for their own  use, on their paying a small portion of the price at  which it was estimated. The church was valued at  13,000 dollars, but they would only be required to pay 3,000 dollars in order to have it for themselves. The negroes were pleased with the idea of having a place  of meeting for themselves, and so were induced to save  every cent they could to buy the chapel. They  were thus provided with a strong motive for remaining where they were, and also by means of this pious fraud, which it afterwards proved itself to be, they were deprived of such little sums of money as might occasionally drop          into their hands, and with which they might have been assisted in effecting their escape. These resolutions were punctually carried into effect; a splendid new church was built for the whites; and it was made a rule of that church, that if any coloured person entered it, without special business, he was liable to be taken to the watch-house and to receive 39 lashes! The negroes  paid what was at first demanded of them for the old  building, but when they wished to get it placed entirely  in their hands, they were charged with a still further  sum; and after they had paid that, they had still more  to pay, and never, so long  asI  was there, got possession  of the church, and probably never will. A minister  was, however, appointed to preach for them beside the  one that preached for the white people.            A man named Knopp who came from the north preached once in the church of the negroes. He took for his text,   O! Jerusalem, Jerusalem which killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thee as a hen gathereth her  chidkens  under her wings, and ye would not.   Mr. Jeter and the members of the whites' church were so offended at this man's sermon, that they went in a body to his lodgings and were about to mob him, if he had not been defended by a number of his own friends; but I believe if he been left to the tender mercies of this professed servant of the Most High, and his christian associates, he would never have escaped with his life.                    The Rev. R [.]  Ryland, who preached for the coloured people, was professor at the Baptist seminary near the city of Richmond, and the coloured people had to pay him a salary of 700 dollars per annum, although they neither chose him nor had the least  controul  over him.  He did not consider himself bound to preach regularly, but only when he was not otherwise engaged, so he preached about 40 sermons a year and was a zealous supporter of the slave-holders' cause; and, so far as I could judge, he had no notion whatever of the pure religion of Jesus Christ. He used to preach from such texts as that in the epistle to the Ephesians, where St. Paul says,  servants be obedient to them that are your masters and mistresses according to the flesh, and  submit to them with fear and trembling ; he was not ashamed to  iuvoke  the authority of heaven in support of the slave degrading laws under which masters could with impunity abuse their fellow creatures.     CHAPTER VI.            I now began to think of entering the matrimonial  state; and with that view I had formed an acquaintance  with a young woman named Nancy, who was a slave  belonging to a Mr. Leigh a clerk in the Bank, and, like many more slave-holders, professing to be a very pious man. We had made it up to get married, but it was necessary      
    the medical profession. Nevertheless, the son often said that he believed God had destined him for the sacred calling, and devoted much of his time in exhorting his neighbors to seek repentance.            Most planters in our section cared but little about the religious training of their slaves, regarding them as they did their cattle,--an investment, the return of which was only to be considered in dollars and cents. Not so, however, with Dr. John Gaines, for he took special pride in looking after the spiritual welfare of his slaves, having them all in the  great house,  at family worship, night and morning.            On Sabbath mornings, reading of the Scriptures, and explaining the same, generally occupied from one to two hours, and often till half of the negroes present were fast asleep. The white members of the family did not take as kindly to the religious teaching of the doctor, as did the blacks.            For his Christian zeal, I had the greatest respect, for I always regarded him as a truly pious and conscientious man, willing at all times to give of his means the needful in spreading the Gospel.            Mrs. Sarah Gaines was a lady of considerable merit, well-educated, and of undoubted piety. If she did not join heartily in her husband's religious enthusiasm, it was not for want of deep and genuine Christian feeling, but from the idea that he was of more humble origin than herself, and, therefore, was not a capable instructor.            This difference in birth, this difference in antecedents does much in the South to disturb family relations     
           Toward the latter part of the summer Captain Reynolds left the boat, and I was sent home. I  was then placed on the farm, under Mr. Haskell, the overseer. As I had been some time out of the field, and not accustomed to work in the burning sun, it was very hard; but I was compelled to keep up with the best of the hands.          I found a great difference between the work in a steamboat cabin and that in a corn-field.          My master, who was then living in the city, soon after removed to the farm, when I was taken out of the field to work in the house as a waiter. Though his wife was very peevish, and hard to please, I much preferred to be under her control than the overseer's. They brought with them Mr. Sloane, a Presbyterian minister; Miss Martha Tulley, a niece of theirs from Kentucky; and their nephew William. The latter had been in the family a number of years, but the others were all new comers.          Mr. Sloane was a young minister, who had been at the South but a short time, and it seemed as if his whole aim was to please the slaveholders, especially  my master and mistress. He was intending to make a visit during the winter, and he not       only tried to please them, but I think he succeeded admirably. When they wanted singing, he sung; when they wanted praying, he prayed; when they wanted a story told, he told a story. Instead of his teaching my master theology, my master taught theology to him. While I was with Captain  Reynolds my master  got religion,  and new laws were made on the plantation. Formerly we had the privilege of hunting, fishing, making splint brooms, baskets,  c., on Sunday; but this was all stopped. Every Sunday we were all compelled  to attend meeting. Master was so religious that he induced some others to join him in hiring preacher to preach to the slaves.      version="1.0"?>        William Wells Brown, 1814?-1884.   Narrative of William W.

[Frontispiece Image]           [Title   as prayer was over, I was taken and severely chastised.          My master's family consisted of himself, his wife, and their nephew, William Moore. He was taken into the family when only a few weeks of age. His name being that of my own, mine was changed for the purpose of giving precedence to his, though I was his senior by ten or twelve years. The plantation being four miles from the city, I had to drive the family to church. I always dreaded the approach of the Sabbath; for, during service, I was obliged to stand by the horses in the hot, broiling sun, or in the rain, just as it happened.          One Sabbath, as we were driving past the house of D. D. Page, a gentleman who owned a large baking establishment, as I was sitting upon the box of the carriage, which was very much elevated, I saw Mr.   same gentleman, but a short time previous, tied up a woman of his, by the name of Delphia, and whipped her nearly to death; yet he was a deacon in the Baptist church, in good and regular standing.  Poor Delphia! I was well acquainted with her, and called to see her while upon her sick bed; and I shall never forget her appearance. She was a member of the same church with her master.          Soon after this, I was hired out to Mr. Walker, the same man whom I have mentioned as having carried a gang of slaves down the river on the steamboat Enterprise. Seeing me in the capacity of a steward on the boat, and thinking that I would make a good hand to take care of slaves, he determined  to have me for that purpose; and finding that my master would not sell me, he hired me for the term of one year.          When I learned the fact of my having been hired to a negro speculator, or a  soul driver,  as they are generally called among slaves, no one can tell my emotions. Mr. Walker had offered a high price for me, as I afterwards learned, but I suppose my master was restrained from selling me by the fact that I was a near relative of his. On entering the service of Mr. Walker, I found that my opportunity      
   fact and said he was going to have Tom Black whip me the next day, which was Saturday; in fact he told him in my presence to do it on Monday morning. But previous to this he called me up to know why I disobeyed his order. I told him that I was not hired for that purpose. Oh, but how he did cut up, yet he did not attempt to strike me.           Before going home to my master, which I certainly should have done, I thought it best to use a little strategy. During Sunday I had a talk with Mr. Black in which I told him my plans. He advised me not to go, and said that unless ordered again he would not attempt to whip me, and even then he would give me plenty of chance to run; but he said he would go and see Mr. Beasley that day. Now what passed between them I am unable to state, but when Mr. Black returned he said it was all right, and it was, for I was never molested after that, and Mr. Beasley revoked the order and had two men detailed to saw wood about four o'clock every evening. I had no more trouble that year with Beasley or his overseer.           I enjoyed life in the factories very much. We had good wholesome food and plenty of it, and when the factory closed at sunset we were free to go where we pleased until sunrise next day. I remember that the M. E. Church, South, allowed the colored people to meet in the basement of their church, and their minister preached to them every Sunday, commencing at three o'clock, P. M., and his text was not always from Luke xii. 47, or Titus ii. 9, but I have no recollection of hearing one preached from Ephesians vi. 9, where the duties of master to servant are explained. Some of the ministers were good men and preached reasonable sermons        giving good advice, spiritually and morally, and were beloved by their colored congregations. I remember one whose name was W. G. Cooper, who was so well admired by his colored flock that they raised forty-five dollars and presented him a suit of clothes, when he went to conference, and sent a petition to have him returned to that charge.           Nearly every slave made some money which he could spend for fine clothes or such other things suited to his taste, so that when attending church I remember that the slaves were dressed almost as nicely as their owners, at any rate they looked as well as I have seen them on like occasions since they have been free.           We had some colored preachers, too, who held prayer meetings in their quarters and preached every Sunday afternoon in the white people's church, but there was always some leading white man present to take note of what the preacher said. If he used words deemed insubordinate or not in keeping with the pro-slavery idea, he was promptly stopped, there and then, and lectured for his mistake, and in some cases his license was recalled. Of course these licenses were granted by his master to preach during good behavior. Not three in ten of these preachers could read their texts or any other part of the Bible, but they stood in the pulpit, opened the Bible, gave out the song which did not always fit the tune, and delivered prayer with much force and in language that, while not the choicest, greatly impressed its hearers.           There were a few colored men who could read the Bible, in and around Brunswick at that time, but none of them were preachers. The men who felt themselves called to preach had no education at all, but had a fair        amount of brain, good memories, were fluent talkers, and considered pious and truthful. They could line a hymn from memory as clearly as their masters could from their books, and take a text and state were it was to be found.           I  remember a story told on Uncle Tom Ewing, an old colored preacher, who was praying on one  occassion , after the close of his sermon, in the church near Jacob Vennable's place, five miles from Brunswick. The old fellow got warmed up, and used the words,  Free indeed, free from death, free from hell, free from work, free from the white folks, free from everything.  After the meeting closed, Jacob Vennable, who sat in front of the pulpit took Tom to task and threatened to have his license revoked if he ever used such language in public. Jacob Vennable was a slave holder and considered a fair master, so I was informed by Jesse, one of his slaves, and others who were supposed to know. I heard Uncle Tom preach and pray many times after the above-described occurrence, but never heard him use the words quoted above.           I remember when a question as to the purity of Christians (whether two clean sheets could soil each other) was being agitated among the colored people in the Bluff, as the hilly portion of the country, five miles east of Brunswick, was then called  It was argued pro and con with considerable warmth on both sides by the preachers and lay members. Considerable excitement was created thereby, and pending this the white men called a meeting and ordered some of the leading advocates of this new doctrine to appear before them, and they were then and there notified that if they did not stop that kind of talk, they, the white people,     
               Among other slave notabilities, I found here one called by everybody, white and colored,  Uncle  Isaac Copper. It was seldom that a slave, however venerable, was honored with a surname in  Maryland, and so completely has the south shaped the manners of the north in this respect that their right to such honor is tardily admitted even now. It goes sadly against the grain to address and treat a negro as one would address and treat a white man. But once in a while, even in a slave state, a negro had a surname fastened to him by common consent. This was the case with  Uncle  Isaac Copper. When the  Uncle  was dropped, he was called Doctor Copper. He was both our Doctor of Medicine and our Doctor of Divinity. Where he took his degree I am unable to say, but he was too well established in his profession to permit question as to his native skill, or attainments. One qualification he certainly had. He was a confirmed cripple, wholly unable to work, and was worth nothing for sale in the market. Though lame, he was no sluggard. He made his crutches do him good service, and was always on the alert looking up the sick, and such as were supposed to need his aid and counsel. His remedial prescriptions embraced four articles. For diseases of the body, epsom salts and castor oil; for those of the soul, the  Lord's prayer,  and a few stout hickory switches.             I was early sent to Doctor Isaac Copper, with twenty or thirty other children, to learn the Lord's prayer. The old man was seated on a huge three-legged oaken stool, armed with several large hickory switches, and from the point where he sat, lame as he was, he could reach every boy in the room. After standing a while to learn what was expected of us, he commanded us to kneel down. This done, he told us to say everything he said.  Our Father --this we repeated after him with promptness and uniformity-- who art in Heaven,  was less promptly and uniformly repeated, and the old gentleman paused in the prayer to give us a short lecture, and to use his switches on our backs.             Everybody in the South seemed to want the privilege of           whipping somebody else. Uncle Isaac, though a good old man, shared the common passion of his time and country. I cannot say I was much edified by attendance upon his ministry. There was even at that time something a little inconsistent and laughable, in my mind, in the blending of prayer with punishment. I was not long in my new home before I found that the dread I had conceived of Captain Anthony was in a measure groundless. Instead of leaping out from some hiding place and destroying me, he hardly seemed to notice my presence.  He probably thought as little of my arrival there, as of an additional pig to his stock. He was the chief agent of his employer. The overseers of all the farms composing the Lloyd estate, were in some sort under him. The Colonel himself seldom addressed an overseer, or allowed himself to be addressed by one. To Captain Anthony, therefore, was committed the  head-ship of all the farms. He carried the keys of all the store-houses, weighed and measured the allowances of each slave, at the end of each month; superintended the storing of all goods brought to the store-house; dealt out the raw material to the different handicraftsmen, shipped the grain, tobacco, and all other saleable produce of the numerous farms to  Baltimore, and had a general oversight of all the workshops of the place. In addition to all this he was frequently called abroad to Easton and elsewhere in the discharge of his numerous duties as chief agent of the estate.             The family of Captain Anthony consisted of two sons--Andrew and Richard, his daughter Lucretia and her newly married husband, Captain Thomas Auld. In the kitchen were Aunt Katy, Aunt Esther, and ten or a dozen children, most of them older than myself. Capt. Anthony was not considered a rich slave-holder, though he was pretty well off in the world. He owned about thirty slaves and three farms in the Tuckahoe district. The more valuable part of his property was in slaves, of whom he sold one every year, which brought him in seven or eight hundred dollars, besides his yearly salary and other revenue from his lands.      
    case with  Uncle  Isaac Copper. When the  Uncle  was dropped, he was called Doctor Copper. He was both our Doctor of Medicine and our Doctor of Divinity. Where he took his degree I am unable to say, but he was too well established in his profession to permit question as to his native skill or attainments. One qualification he certainly had.

   was too well established in his profession to permit questions as to his native skill, or his attainments. One qualification he undoubtedly had--he was a confirmed  cripple;  and he could neither work, nor would he bring anything if offered for sale in the market. The old man, though lame, was no sluggard. He was a man that made his crutches do him good service. He was always on the alert, looking up the sick, and all such as were supposed to need his counsel. His remedial prescriptions embraced four articles. For diseases of the body,  Epsom salts  and  castor oil;  for those of the soul,  the Lord's Prayer,  and  hickory switches!            I was not long at Col. Lloyd's before I was placed under the care of Doctor Isaac Copper. I was sent to him with twenty or thirty other children, to learn the  Lord's Prayer.  I found the old gentleman seated on a huge three-legged oaken stool, armed with several large hickory switches; and, from his position, he could reach--lame as he was--any boy in the room. After standing awhile to learn what was expected of us, the old gentleman, in any other than a devotional tone, commanded us to kneel down. This done, he commenced telling us to say everything he said.  Our Father --this we repeated after him with promptness and uniformity;  Who art in heaven --was less promptly and uniformly repeated; and the old gentleman paused in the prayer, to give us a short lecture upon the consequences of inattention, both immediate and future, and especially those more immediate. About these he was absolutely certain, for he held in his right hand the means of        bringing all his predictions and warnings to pass. On he proceeded with the prayer; and we with our hick tongues and unskilled ears, followed him to the best of our ability. This, however, was not sufficient to please the old gentleman. Everybody, in the south, wants the privilege of whipping somebody else. Uncle Isaac shared the common passion of his country, and, therefore, seldom found any means of keeping his disciples in order short of flogging.  Say everything I say;  and bang would come the switch on some poor boy's undevotional head.   What you looking at there -- Stop that pushing  --and down again would come the lash.           The whip is all in all. It is supposed to secure obedience to the slaveholder, and is held as a sovereign remedy among the slaves themselves, for every form of disobedience, temporal or spiritual. Slaves, as well as slaveholders, use it with an unsparing hand. Our devotions at Uncle Isaac's combined too much of the tragic and comic, to make them very salutary in a spiritual point of view; and it is due to truth to say, I was often a truant when the time for attending the praying and flogging of Doctor Isaac Copper came on.           The windmill under the care of Mr. Kinney, a kind hearted old Englishman, was to me a source of infinite interest and pleasure. The old man always seemed pleased when he saw a troop of darkey little urchins, with their tow-linen shirts fluttering in the breeze, approaching to view and admire the whirling wings of his wondrous machine. From the mill we could see other objects of deep interest. These were,     
   under the ground in Southampton County. He was an exhorter early, and had acquired great influence over the slaves, and this he used to incite them, to combine and to murder their masters and their families, and thus free themselves from slavery. Several whole families were sacrificed to this horrid and cruel infatuation 'ere its leaders were discovered, and severe retribution was dealt to all supposed to have knowledge of the plot. John was seized by the city guard, being out after eight o'clock, and thrown into prison, but being recognized by the captain, to whom he was taken, and his good faith proved, he was returned unharmed to his master's domains.           The State Government soon after enacted a law prohibiting colored men entirely from preaching and exhorting, or even gathering for prayer meetings, except at the leaves of their respective owners. These were hard laws to submit to, their situation as slaves being made bearable to some only by the soothing counsels and influence of their christian brethren. But the moral courage of a few of the preachers rose superior to the laws of the land, when they were in violation of the laws of God as revealed in the Scriptures. Among such men was one Pleasant Randall, the property of Mr. Harrison, of Charles City, who deemed his commission to make the Gospel known to sinners, to be from the Lord, and not from man.           When gone into Prince George County, one Saturday, to preach for a couple of days, the planters in the vicinity visited his master, Mr. Harrison, urging him to restrain Randall, or shut him up, saying, that his preaching so affected their people that they would bear beating and beating, and then hear him again at the first opportunity--they could not thus spare their time, and the man ought, by the laws, to be hung--and  they  should do something to     
     sisters in play. I felt very ill after it, and thought if I feigned to be dead, she would get a whipping. I began to groan out. The women in the spinning-room ran out, thinking I was dying. My mistress's sister, and two young lady visitors, ran into the room; and, feeling I was cold, and noticing that I breathed but slowly--which I was managing, as well as I could, taking a good gasp every time--they turned me over. They also were afraid that I was dying. They began to cry, which brought my mistress into the kitchen. She began to cry, at first; and then, looking  stedfastly  at me,  Stand by,  she said, taking out a pin, unseen by me, she thrust it right into me. I struck out with my feet, and sent a black woman, who had been rubbing me, sprawling on the ground. I holloed out,  Oh! oh! oh!  until they could hear me a mile off. Some ran away instantly, from fear; others burst into loud fits of laughter; my mistress joining in the laugh.  Well,  she said,  I never saw such an artful nigger in all my life. He is always up to of his tricks.             I had a tolerably good time of it now, being in the kitchen, helping to cook, or waiting at the table, listening eagerly to any conversation going on; and thus learning many things, of which the field-hands were totally ignorant.        Sunday at Chapel.             On Sundays we were sent to chapel; all the         slaves being seated in the galleries, apart from the white people.            Mr. Pain, the minister, was absent from chapel, one Sabbath; but, appearing next Sunday, he explained his absence, by informing his congregation that two of his slaves had run away. Immediately, there was a general lamentation, because brother Pain had lost his slaves; and many calculations were made about their value. The following Sunday, the minister, with a face radiant with joy, announced to his audience, that his slaves had been brought back to him. On hearing this, a hubbub of delight pervaded the chapel; but, when he further informed them, that he had administered to each eighty lashes, in order to teach them their duty, and to deter them and others from running away in future, the audience were overjoyed; one saying to another,  Brother Pain has done perfectly right. He has taught them, and all the slaves who hear, what their duty is, and how they are to be dealt with, if they attempt to run away.               When first I came to England, I was surprised to find every clergyman and Dissenting minister, to a man, denouncing slavery, as contrary to Christianity. But the reverse is the case in the Southern States of America. All the Methodists, Baptists, and Independents--in fact, every minister of religion--uphold slavery, and defend it by passages from the very same Book out of which the clergy, in this country, make quotations to condemn it.                    I leave the natural inference to be drawn by themselves; merely suggesting, that, perhaps, self-interest may, in other cases also, cause fatal delusions and compliances.        Christmas, how spent by Slaves.             About Christmas, my master would give four or five days' holiday to his slaves; during which time, he supplied them plentifully with new whiskey, which kept them in a continual state of the most beastly intoxication. He often absolutely forced them to drink more, when they had told him they had had enough. He would then call them together, and say,  Now, you slaves, don't you see what bad use you have been making of your liberty? Don't you think you had better have a master, to look after you, and make you work, and keep you from such a brutal state, which is a disgrace to you, and would ultimately be an injury to the community at large?  Some of the slaves, in that whining, cringing manner, which is one of the baneful effects of slavery, would reply,  Yees, Massa; if we go on in dis way, no good at all.              Thus, by an artfully-contrived plan, the slaves themselves are made to put the seal upon their own servitude. The masters, by the system, are rendered as cunning and scheming as the slaves themselves.                  Joe,  said a master,  if you will work well for me, you shall be buried in my grave.  The slave     
    it. I could hardly move after the terrible ordeal was  finished, and could scarcely bear my clothes to touch  me at first, so sore was my whole body, and it was  weeks before I was myself again.    PREACHING TO THE SLAVES.             As an offset, probably, to such diabolical cruelties  as those which were practiced upon me in common  with nearly all the slaves in the cotton region of the  south, it was the custom in the section of country  where I lived to have the white minister preach to the  servants Sunday afternoon, after the morning service  for the whites. The white people hired the minister  by the year to preach for them at their church. Then  he had to preach to each master's slaves in turn. The  circuit was made once a month, but there was service  of some kind every Sunday. The slaves on some  places gathered in the yard, at others in the white  folks' school houses, and they all seemed pleased and  eager to hear the word of God. It was a strong evidence  of their native intelligence and discrimination  that they could discern the difference between the  truths of the  word  and the professed practice of  those truths by their masters. My Boss took pride in  having all his slaves look clean any tidy at the Sabbath         service; but how would he have liked to have the  slaves, with backs lacerated with the lash, appear in  those assemblies with their wounds uncovered?  The  question can never be answered. The master and  most of his victims have gone where professions of  righteousness will not avail to cover the barbarities  practiced here.    A FAMILY OF FREE PERSONS SOLD INTO SLAVERY.             My wife Matilda was born in Fayette county,  Kentucky, June 17th, 1830. It seems that her mother  and her seven children were to have been free according  to the old Pennsylvania law. There were two  uncles of the family who were also to have been free,  but who had been kept over time; so they sued for  their freedom, and gained it. The lawyers in the  case were abolitionists and friends to the slaves, and saw that these men had justice. After they had  secured their freedom, they entered suit for my wife's  mother, their sister, and her seven children. But as  soon as the brothers entered this suit, Robert Logan,  who claimed my wife's mother and her children as his  slaves, put them into a trader's yard in Lexington;  and, when he saw that there was a possibility of their  being successful in securing their freedom, he put      
     bondage. Though the parting was painful, it afforded her  solace in the contemplation of her husband becoming a free man, and cherishing a hope that her little family, through the aid of some angel of mercy, might be enabled to make their escape also, and meet to part no more on earth. My father came to spend the night with us, according to his usual custom. It was the last time, and sadness brooded upon his brow. It was the  only opportunity he had to make his escape without suspicion  and detection, as he was immediately to fall into the hands of a new master. He had never been sold from the place of his birth before, and was determined never to be sold again if God would verify his promise. My father was not educated, but  was a preacher, and administered the Word of God according to  the dictation and revelation of the spirit. His former master  had allowed him the privilege of holding meetings in the village within the limits of his pass on the Sundays when he visited my mother. But on this Saturday evening he arrived and gave us  all his farewell kiss and hurried away. My mother's people were aware of my father's intention, but rather than spare my mother, and for fear she might be detected, they secreted his escape. His master called a number of times and enquired for  him and strongly pressed my mother to give him an account of  my father, but she never gave it. We waited patiently, hoping  to learn if he succeeded in gaining his freedom. Many anxious  weeks and months passed before we could get any tidings from  him, until at length my mother heard that he was in Chicago, a  free man and preaching the Gospel. He made every effort to  get his family, but all in vain. The spirit of slavery so strongly  existed that letters could not reach her; they were all destroyed .  My parents had never learned the rescuing scheme of the  underground railroad which had borne so many thousands to the  standard of freedom and victories. They knew no other  resource than to depend upon their own chance in running away  and secreting themselves. If caught they were in a worse  condition than before.        
         XIII.    THE CHURCH AND SLAVERY.           AFTER the alarm caused by Nat Turner's insurrection had subsided, the slaveholders came to the conclusion that it would be well to give the slaves enough of religious instruction to keep them from murdering their masters. The Episcopal clergyman offered to hold a separate service on Sundays for their benefit. His  colored members were very few, and also very respectable a fact which I presume had some weight with him. The difficulty was to decide on a suitable place for them to worship. The Methodist and Baptist churches admitted them in the afternoon, but their carpets and cushions were not so costly as those at the Episcopal church. It was at last decided that they should meet at the house of a free colored man, who was a member.           I was invited to attend, because I could read. Sunday evening came, and, trusting to the cover of night, I ventured out. I rarely ventured out by daylight, for I always went with fear, expecting at every turn to encounter Dr. Flint, who was sure to turn me back, or order me to his office to inquire where I got my bonnet, or some other article of dress. When the Rev. Mr. Pike came, there were some twenty persons present.  The reverend gentleman knelt in prayer, then seated himself, and requested all present, who could read, to open their books, while he gave out the  portions he wished them to repeat or respond to.                    His text was,  Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ.            Pious Mr. Pike brushed up his hair till it stood upright, and, in deep, solemn tones, began:  Hearken, ye servants! Give strict heed unto my words. You are rebellious sinners. Your hearts are filled with all manner of evil. 'Tis the devil who tempts you. God is angry with you, and will surely punish you, if you don't forsake your wicked ways. You that live in town are eye-servants behind your master's back. Instead of serving your masters faithfully, which is pleasing in the sight of your heavenly Master, you are idle, and shirk your work. God sees you. You tell lies. God hears you. Instead of being engaged in worshipping him, you are hidden away somewhere, feasting on your master's substance; tossing coffee-grounds with some wicked fortuneteller, or cutting cards with another old hag. Your masters may not find you out, but God sees you, and will punish you. O, the depravity of your hearts! When your master's work is done, are you quietly together, thinking of the goodness of God to such sinful creatures? No; you are quarrelling, and tying up little bags of roots to bury under the door-steps to poison each other with. God sees you. You men steal away to every grog shop to sell your master's corn, that you may buy rum to drink. God sees you. You sneak into the back streets, or among the bushes, to pitch coppers. Although your masters may not find you out, God sees you; and he will punish you. You must forsake           your sinful ways, and be faithful servants. Obey your old master and your young master your old mistress and your young mistress. If you disobey your earthly master, you offend your heavenly Master. You must obey God's commandments. When you go from here, don't stop at the corners of the streets to talk, but go directly home, and let your master and mistress see that you have come.            The benediction was pronounced. We went home, highly amused at brother Pike's gospel teaching, and we determined to hear him again. I went the next Sabbath evening, and heard pretty much a repetition of the last discourse. At the close of the meeting, Mr. Pike informed us that he found it very inconvenient to meet at the friend's house, and he should be glad to see us, every Sunday evening, at his own kitchen.           I went home with the feeling that I had heard the Reverend Mr. Pike for the last time. Some of his members repaired to his house, and found that the kitchen sported two tallow candles; the first time, I am sure, since its present occupant owned it, for the servants never had any thing but pine knots. It was so long before the reverend gentleman descended from his comfortable parlor that the slaves left, and went to enjoy a Methodist shout. They never seem so happy as when shouting and singing at religious meetings. Many of them are sincere, and nearer to the gate of heaven than sanctimonious Mr. Pike, and other long-faced Christians, who see wounded Samaritans, and pass by on the other side.           The slaves generally compose their own songs and          hymns, and they do not trouble their heads much about the measure. They often sing the following verses:    Old Satan is one busy ole man;         If I had died when I was young,                 I well remember one occasion when I attended a Methodist class meeting. I went with a burdened spirit, and happened to sit next a poor, bereaved mother, whose heart was still heavier than mine. The class leader was the town constable a man who bought and sold slaves, who whipped his brethren and sisters of the church at the public whipping post, in jail or out of jail. He was ready to perform that Christian office any where for fifty cents. This white-faced, black-hearted brother came near us, and said to the stricken woman,  Sister, can't you tell us how the Lord deals with your soul? Do you love him as you did formerly?            She rose to her feet, and said, in piteous tones,  My Lord and Master, help me! My load is more than I can bear. God has hid himself from me, and I am left in darkness and misery.  Then, striking her breast, she continued,  I can't tell you what is in here! They've got all my children. Last week they took the last one. God only knows where they've sold her. They let me have her sixteen years, and then O! O! Pray for her brothers and sisters!           I've got nothing to live for now. God make my time short!            She sat down, quivering in every limb. I saw that constable class leader become crimson in the face with suppressed laughter, while he held up his handkerchief, that those who were weeping for the poor woman's calamity might not see his merriment. Then, with assumed gravity, he said to the bereaved mother,  Sister, pray to the Lord that every dispensation of his divine will may be sanctified to the good of your poor needy soul!            The congregation struck up a hymn, and sung as though they were as free as the birds that warbled round us,     Ole Satan thought he had a mighty aim;   He took my sins upon his back;   Ole Satan's church is here below.              Precious are such moments to the poor slaves. If you were to hear them at such times, you might think they were happy. But can that hour of singing and shouting sustain them through the dreary week, toiling without wages, under constant dread of the lash?           The Episcopal clergyman, who, ever since my earliest recollection, had been a sort of god among the slaveholders, concluded, as his family was large, that he must go where money was more abundant. A           very different clergyman took his place. The change was very agreeable to the colored people, who said,  God has sent us a good man this time.  They loved him, and their children followed him for a smile or a kind word. Even the slaveholders felt his influence. He brought to the rectory five slaves. His wife taught them to read and write, and to be useful to her and themselves. As soon as he was settled, he turned his attention to the needy slaves around him. He urged upon his parishioners the duty of having a meeting expressly for them every Sunday, with a sermon adapted to their comprehension. After much argument and importunity, it was finally agreed that they might occupy the gallery of the church on Sunday evenings. Many colored people, hitherto unaccustomed to attend church, now gladly went to hear the gospel preached. The sermons were simple, and they understood them. Moreover, it was the first time they had ever been addressed as human beings. It was not long before his white parishioners began to be dissatisfied. He was accused of preaching better sermons to the negroes than he did to them. He honestly confessed that he bestowed more pains upon those sermons than upon any others; for the slaves were reared in such ignorance that it was a difficult task to adapt himself to their comprehension. Dissensions arose in the parish. Some wanted he should preach to them in the evening, and to the slaves in the afternoon. In the midst of these disputings his wife died, after a very short illness. Her slaves gathered round her dying bed in great sorrow. She said,  I have tried to do you good and promote your happiness; and if I have           failed, it has not been for want of interest in your welfare. Do not weep for me; but prepare for the new duties that lie before you. I leave you all free. May we meet in a better world.  Her liberated slaves were sent away, with funds to establish them comfortably. The colored people will long bless the memory of that truly Christian woman. Soon after her death her husband preached his farewell sermon, and many tears were shed at his departure.           Several years after, he passed through our town and preached to his former congregation. In his afternoon sermon he addressed the colored people.  My friends,  said he,  it affords me great happiness to have an opportunity of speaking to you again. For two years I have been striving to do something for the colored people of my own parish; but nothing is yet accomplished. I have not even preached a sermon to them. Try to live according to the word of God, my friends. Your skin is darker than mine; but God judges men by their hearts, not by the color of their skins.  This was strange doctrine from a southern pulpit. It was very offensive to slaveholders. They said he and his wife had made fools of their slaves, and that he preached like a fool to the negroes.           I knew an old black man, whose piety and childlike trust in God were beautiful to witness. At fifty-three years old he joined the Baptist church. He had a most earnest desire to learn to read. He thought he should know how to serve God better if he could only read the Bible. He came to me, and begged me to teach him. He said he could not pay me, for he had      
     of age. My master was a member of the Episcopalian Church, and would teach me to say my prayers, and the Apostles' Creed, and read to me about Abraham's servants and Isaac's servants, and Jacob's servants, and  servants, obey your masters.  He would read these  wise  precepts over to me so carefully, have prayers, and then, when he felt like it (which he often did), gave me a lashing. And whenever he thought I ought to have a flogging, he would say to me:  Report yourself to me to-morrow morning after breakfast.  If I did not report to get my flogging, I would have an extra lashing for that. Yet, with all this, my lot was much better than many of those around me. There was a man who owned the next plantation whose name was Jackson. He was so cruel to the slaves that he was known to them as  the devil.  I remember well how I used to think of  seeking religion,  but whenever I began to think seriously on this matter, a great obstacle confronted me. I was superstitious. Superstition is characteristic of the race in Africa. Having been brought to America, not permitted to be taught to read the Bible, and having every avenue to education closed against us, it was natural we should retain the superstitions of our fathers. My idea was that if I set out to  seek religion,  I must meet with that old serpent, the devil. I often heard slaves say that when they set out to  seek religion,  the devil set out with them, and this greatly perplexed me. Then I heard them talk of seeing ghosts. But after they were converted they would go six and ten miles at night to a meeting, and God would be with them. I resolved to set out definitely to get religion, with all my strange thoughts and fears. I thought the worst sin a man could be guilty of was murder. I knew I was innocent of that. One day, I was out gathering blackberries, and commenced to pray the Lord's Prayer; I knew not what else to say. As I prayed, a rabbit jumped up from under the bush from which I was gathering the berries. I felt sure     
     read.  And on the Sabbath there was one sermon preached expressly for the colored people which it was generally my privilege to hear.  I became quite familiar with the texts,  Servants be obedient to your masters. -- Not with eye service as men pleasers. -- He that knoweth his master's will and doeth it not, shall be beaten with many stripes,  and others of this class: for they formed the basis of most of these public instructions to us.  The first commandment impressed upon our minds was to obey our masters, and the second was like unto it, namely, to do as much work when they or the overseers were not watching us as when they were.  But connected with these instructions there was more or less that was truly excellent; though mixed up with much that would sound strangely in the ears of freedom.  There was one very kind hearted Episcopal minister whom I often used to hear; he was very popular with the colored people.  But after he had preached a sermon to us in which he argued from the Bible that it was the will of heaven from all eternity we should be slaves, and our masters be our owners, most of us left him; for like some of the faint hearted disciples in early times we said,-- This is a hard saying, who can bear it?             My manumission, as I shall call it; that is, the bill of sale conveying me to Mr. Smith, was dated Sept. 9th, 1835. I continued     
      are far ahead of the members of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Maryland and Delaware. Such is the prejudice against color in my own church, that if, upon a public occasion in the Lord's House, at a baptism or at a reception of members into the church, I were to invite the colored candidates to come forward and kneel around the same altar at the same time, I should expect to be ordered off the circuit or station by the members of the church themselves.             According to our custom, in the administration of the Lord's Supper, the preachers take the bread and wine first; then the white laity; and afterward the colored members of our church. If any preacher should advocate the doctrine that colored and white members ought to kneel at the same altar side by side, and together thus partake of bread and wine in commemoration of the Saviour's death, and attempt to carry his doctrine into practice, he would grossly insult the white members, he would be denounced as an amalgamationist, he would have to leave for a free State, and would, perhaps, receive a rebuke from his superior in office for his impertinence. I am no leveller outside of the church walls. In          society, let every man know his own place. But in the church, the beggar and the prince, the white and the colored man, the rich and the poor, the master and the servant, should kneel together. Our Divine Master set us the example of washing the saints' feet. Some think that, in heaven, the negroes will all be made white. I once heard a colored man, in relating his experience in a love-feast, say that, if he should be so happy as to get to heaven, he  expected to have a white face, just like his white brethren!              The M. E. Church has recently sent a missionary to India. Now we have read that in India there exist four castes or classes. Some of these classes will not come in contact with each other. Suppose that some of each class should profess faith in Christianity under Brother Butler, our missionary to India, and that the higher class of Hindoos should refuse to take the sacrament at the same time it is partaken of by the converts of the poorer classes, and that our minister should yield to their claims. What would the church do? Why, she would recall him; and it would be right so to do. Yet every     
      stay with me sometimes until 2 or 3 o'clock P. M., and learn me to cypher to the single rule of three.             I arrived at Hartford on the 15th of Nov., 1835. Since that time some of my good white friends have assisted me by referring me to good books, and giving good instruction, of which I have reason to believe some of them are in heaven, and others on earth doing good.             My mother's and father's theology, or the way we children were taught by our parents, neither of them could read; but as mother's master was a member of the M. E. church, and used to read the Bible to his slaves--not learn nor teach them to read, but read the Bible to them.             First, man is a compound being, possessing two natures, a soul and a body; the body is of the earth, and must die and return to the dust from whence it came; but the soul is immortal; that is, will never die, but will live forever     
           There are several circumstances which occurred  on this estate while I was there, relative to other slaves, which it may be interesting to mention.   Hardly a day ever passed without some one being flogged.  To one of his female slaves he had given a dose of castor oil and salts together,  as much as she could take; he then got a box, about six feet by two and a half, and one and a half feet deep; he put this slave under the box, and made the men fetch as many stones as they could get, and put them on the top of it; under this she was made to stay all night.  I believe,  that if he had given this slave one, he had given her three thousand lashes.  Mr. Gooch was a member of a Baptist church.  His slaves, thinking him a very bad sample of what a professing  Christian ought to be, would not join the connexion he belonged to, thinking they must be a very bad set of people; there were many of them members of the Methodist church.  On Sunday, the slaves can only go to church at the will of their master, when he gives them a pass for the time they are to be out.  If they are found by the patrole after the time to which their pass extends, they are severely flogged.      
    slave, on being whipped, calls upon God, he is forbidden to do so, under threat of having his throat cut, or brains blown out. O, reader! this seems very hard,--that slaves cannot call on their Maker, when the case most needs it. Sometimes the poor slave takes courage to ask his master to let him pray, and is driven away with the answer, that if discovered praying, his back will pay the bill.             Mr. James L. Goltney was a Baptist preacher, and was employed by Mr. M. B. Harrison to give religious instruction to his slaves. He often used the common text:  Servants, obey your masters.  He would try to make it appear that he knew what the slaves were thinking of,--telling them they thought they had a right to be free, but he could tell them better,--referring them to some passages of Scripture.  It is the devil,  he would say,  who tells you to try and be free.  And again he bid them be patient at work, warning them that it would be his duty to whip them, if they appeared dissatisfied,--all which would be pleasing to God!  If you run away, you will be turned out of God's church, until you repent, return, and ask God and your master's pardon.  In this way he would continue to preach his slaveholding gospel.             This same Goltney used to administer the Lord's Supper to the slaves. After such preaching, let no one say that the slaves have the Gospel of Jesus preached to them.             One of the Baptist ministers was named B. Harrison. He owned slaves, and was very cruel to them. He came to an untimely end. While he was riding out one afternoon, the report of a gun was heard, and he was found dead,--his brains being blown out. It could never be found who killed him, and so he went to judgment, with all his sins on his head.             Mr. L. Hanner was a Christian preacher, selecting texts like the following:  The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,     
      consent of their masters. Then no matter how hard they worked  they had nothing which they could call their own. Even their  children did not belong to them. And they themselves were  liable to be sold away to a distant part of the country to a  master whom they did not know and who might be very cruel to  them. Then as there were no schools for us and as we could  not read you can see how we would want to go to camp meetings  or to church. So we were always glad when Sunday came. On  Sunday, masters and slaves all went to church together.             Our master was a very religious man, being a local preacher  in the Methodist church. Once every three months the  Presiding Elder used to visit the church and hold a quarterly  meeting after he had preached. On one of those visits an  incident occurred that I still remember even after so many  years. It showed how bitter our masters were toward any one  who sympathized with us. And it marked, too, the breaking off  of religious association between our part of the South and  the North.      III             I cannot remember when the church incident with relation to  the Presiding Elder occurred, but it could not have been so  very long before the beginning of the war. We slaves used to  go to the same church our master and the other plantation  owners attended. Of course we used to sit back by the door  by ourselves while they sat up front. The church was about  five miles away from our plantation. We slaves used to walk  while our masters rode. This Sunday for some reason they  left me at home. But after they were gone I happened to  think of a donkey I often rode and the thought occurred to me  that I might ride him to church. So I got on his back and  started off. He carried me to church in good style but when  we reached there instead of waiting for me to get off he  threw me off. I had no rope to tie him, so I left him outside  and went in the church. The result was that he got in a fight  with another donkey while the church services was in progress  and created such a disturbance that I was later given a  severe whipping for it.             But another thing happened during that service which caused  a greater commotion than my donkey. Mr. Ayers, the Presiding  Elder, called upon a colored man named Ennis Dilamar to pray.  Ennis was a slave who had recently been purchased by my  master and who had quite a local reputation as a religious  man. The fact that Mr. Ayers should call upon a slave to pray  caused great offense to the plantation owners and after the  service was over and while the masters and their families  were arranging themselves on the ground to eat their dinner,  my master called Ennis to him and asked him what he meant by  asking God to send the time when Ethiopia should stretch  forth her arm like an army with banners, and said that he  would teach him better than to use such words as that. Of  course Ennis could not make any reply to this. He had simply  been repeating what he had heard some white man say, because  he himself could neither read nor write. However, they gave  him a severe whipping right then and there. This seemed to  disturb Mr. Ayers very much. He withdrew from the company and  went over to where the slaves were preparing their dinner and  told them that he did not see why a Christian man could not  be allowed to use his gift of prayer even if he was black.  In some way this remark got to the white people. So when the  afternoon meeting was called my master told Mr. Ayers that  his service was no longer wanted and that he need not visit  the church any more. From that time on my master had charge  of the meetings as local preacher and we never saw Mr. Ayers  again.             This incident, as I say, must have happened a short time  before the beginning of the war, because shortly afterwards  Samuel Hymans, a young man from our community who was  attending West Point, came home for a vacation, but when the  vacation was over he did not return to West Point. Instead  he commenced to organize a company of soldiers. I was very  anxious to go with him as his servant and my master, at his  request, let me do so. The reason why I was anxious to go  with Hymans was because I wanted to learn how to drill. I did  learn to drill. In fact I learned how to drill so well that  after a while when he was busy with other matters he would  tell me to drill the company for him. After Fort Sumpter      
     mind:-- Here have I been praying to Jesus, whom I have never served, and have never thought of praying to the Devil, whom I have always served.  This was a new revelation. He saw it was unreasonable to expect help from a Being whose service he had not entered. He saw that repentance and reformation of life were the first steps for him to take. Thus put upon the right path by the Infinite Spirit working with his spirit, he soon found the help and peace that he sought.             After a suitable lapse of time, he applied to Col. Suttle, according to custom, for leave to be baptized; no slave being suffered to comply with that command of the Saviour or admitted to the church without a written permission from his owner. To Anthony's request, Col. Suttle, irritated by the prospect of loss from the maimed hand, returned a rough refusal, and even added words to wound the spirit of the young convert. If he joined the church, Suttle said, he would soon be drinking or following the women, like others. Anthony turned away with a heavy heart, but still with a silent resolve to pray that God would yet incline his owner to grant his request. The prayer was answered. Returning some time after from Foote's, where he had again resumed his labor in the mill, he unexpectedly met his owner in a carriage, on his way to the Springs. The latter kindly saluted him, and now of his own accord gave the requisite permission for baptism. Emboldened by such rare favor, Anthony petitioned for money to buy clothes in           which to appear with decency on the occasion of taking his baptismal vows, and received two dollars,--sixteen- fold more than Col. Suttle ever gave him at any one time, before or after.             At the proper time he was baptized and received into the Baptist church at Falmouth. The church consisted of white freemen and black slaves. All assembled within the same walls for worship on the Sabbath, but a partition of boards separated the bond from the free. When the Holy Supper was administered, the cup was first carefully served to all of the privileged class, and afterward to their sable brethren. Those distinctions were not maintained in anticipation of heaven, but in deference to the prejudices of Virginia society. In the social religious meetings there was a somewhat nearer approach to the New Testament model, and the prayers and exhortations of the slaves were graciously suffered to intermingle with those proceeding from the master's lips.             Among the Christian slaves at the south there is a class of persons that bear the character of quasi-pastors or preachers. Without being formally set apart to the sacred office by any rite of ordination, they yet receive a sort of recognition from the church with which they may happen to be connected. Piety, a gift at exhortation, and a desire for the work of a preacher, are the requisite qualifications. All these were found in Anthony when, at the end of two years from the period of his baptism, he applied to his brethren for their recognition      
     else should chastise his slaves. I lived with him two years.             He had a hired plantation about thirty-five miles from his father's, where were my father, mother and five brothers; all having been hired out to him. Here I had an opportunity of improving in my education, for many of the planters in this region were not only rich, but humane, and many of their slaves could read and write. Miserable loafing white people were scarce in that vicinity, their services not being needed. Neither was slave hunting much practised, therefore there was no patroling, and the land being less cursed by cruelty, was rich and fertile; producing in abundance corn, wheat, and tobacco, together with cotton enough for home consumption.             Religion also flourished in that region, where there were no Catholic churches, but only Methodists and Episcopalians. Finally the masters concluded to build a church for their slaves. So they united in the work and soon had a large church, under the  superintendance  of a white preacher; although a colored man could preach in it, if qualified and licensed by the whites. The congregation was large. Many white people went there to hear the colored ones sing and praise God, and were often much affected by their simple but earnest devotion.             Mr. Thomas, being a lawyer of great reputation and extensive practise, was necessarily often called from home on business, disconnected with his farm; consequently he employed an overseer to attend to this and the slaves. This overseer was a very proud and haughty fellow, made so by this sudden promotion; he never before     
   took up the case of a violation of God's law upon the part of Reuben, by running away. The Rev. Wm. Baynaham was the pastor. We assembled in church-meeting on Sunday to deal with the case (as the reverend gentleman said) according to Scripture. He first preached a sermon from this text:-- Godliness with contentment is great gain.  1 Tim., vi. 6. From this text this divine brought out all that handcuffed gospel which is so prevalent in the slave-holding churches of America. His object was to show the inconsistency of discontentment; proving by his peculiar tact of reasoning that slaves should be contented, knowing that it is the Lord's will that they should be the slaves of white men. Being a member of this church, I concluded to leave it, and seek a home in some place better suited to my feelings and opinions with regard to the system of slavery. The sermon being concluded, the case of Reuben was introduced as one worthy of the strictest discipline. After remarks by the minister, who was the moderator, it was moved by one of the slaves, a fellow deacon to Reuben that Reuben be expelled for running away. The motion was seconded by another of the same class of deacons. It was then put to vote by the moderator. I did not know what to do about voting, for it was dangerous  not  to vote; and I could not see, notwithstanding the sermon, that Reuben had done anything justifying his exclusion. I well knew if I refused to vote for Reuben's exclusion that it would at once settle the point that I  sympathised  with    
       Done!  retorted the other. The noise of the fall and the confusion which followed, brought up to the owner, who called for a doctor.  No! no! we must have no interference; there's a bet depending!   But, Sir, I shall lose a valuable servant.   Never mind; you can put him down in the bill!  was their reply. The poor fellow, after suffering some length of time, finally came to. I merely state this fact, as I could many others, to show the passion for gaming the Southerners have, and the brutish manner in which a slave is treated.             Two years of my life passed away without any particular interruption, when, one Sunday afternoon, I got into a dispute with another slave. High words were followed by blows; when I got exasperated, having drank freely of liquor, and stabbed him. I was immediately arrested and put in jail and kept till morning, when I was examined in court. My master, in the meantime, had engaged the services of a distinguished lawyer by the name of S.S. Prentiss, who by his able arguments extricated me from punishment by law; but recommended my master to flog me, which he followed to the letter. The slave with whom I had the difficulty was not injured so as to cause death, and eventually recovered.             I had never been to a meeting of a religious nature since I had been in the city; but, soon after the difficulty I have just mentioned, my master changed the hour for dinner, which enabled us to go to church. There was a Methodist meeting-house on the hill near the jail to which our master allowed us all to go every Sunday afternoon, as we could not go in the forenoon, where we heard the word of the minister preached to us,           who was a white man; the law making it necessary that white persons should be present at all assemblages of slaves or free negroes. The object of all the slaveholders in having their slaves go to church can be clearly seen by the following sermon, which, or one very similar to it, I recollect hearing while worshipping at this church, which has been published and circulated quite extensively at the South:--  'All things whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so unto them:' That is, do by all mankind just as you would desire they should do by you if you were in their place, and they in yours. Now, to suit this rule to your particular circumstances: suppose you were masters and mistresses, and had servants under you; would you not desire that your servants should do their business faithfully and honestly, as well when your back was turned as while you were looking over them? Would you not expect that they should take notice of what you said to them; that they should behave themselves with respect towards you and yours; and be as careful of everything belonging to you, as you would be yourself? You are servants; do, therefore, as you wish to be done by, and you will be both good servants to your masters and to your God, who requires this of you, and will reward you well for it, if you do it for the sake of conscience, in obedience to his commands. Take care that you do not fret, or murmur, or grumble at your condition, for this will not only make your life uneasy, but will greatly offend Almighty God. Consider, this it is not yourselves; it is not the people you belong to; it is not the men that have brought you to it; but it is the will of God, who hath by wise providence made you servants, because,           no doubt, he knew that condition would be best for you in this world and help you the better toward heaven, if you would but do your duty in it; so that any discontent at your not being free, or rich, or great as some others, is quarrelling with your Heavenly Master, and finding fault with God himself. There is only one circumstance which may appear grievous; that I shall now take notice of,--and that is, correction. Now, let us see what the Scriptures say on this point. 'The servant that knoweth his master's will and doeth it not, shall be beaten with many stripes.' Now, does this not apply directly to yourselves? Now, when correction is given to you, you either deserve it, or you do not deserve it; but, whether you really deserve it or not, it is your duty, and Almighty God requires, that you bear it patiently. You may perhaps think that this is hard doctrine; but if you consider right, you must needs think otherwise of it. Suppose, then, that you deserve correction, you cannot but say that it is right and just you should meet with it. Suppose, then, that you deserve correction, you cannot but say that it is right and just you should meet with it. Suppose you do not deserve it, or at least do not deserve so much punishment for the fault you have committed, you perhaps have escaped a great many more, and are at last paid for all. Or, suppose you are quite innocent of what is laid to your charge, and suffer wrongfully in that particular thing; is it not possible you may have done some other bad thing, which was never discovered, and that Almighty God, who saw you doing it, would not let you escape without punishment some time or another? and ought you not in such a case to give glory to him, and be thankful that he would rather punish you in this world for your wickedness than destroy your souls for it in the next? But, suppose that this even was not the            case,--a case hardly to be imagined; and that you have by no means, known or unknown, deserved the correction you have received, there is this great comfort in it, that if you bear it patiently and leave your cause in your hands of God, he will reward you for it in heaven; and this punishment you suffer unjustly here, shall turn to your exceeding great glory hereafter.              Such, my readers, is the doctrine which is preached to the poor slave; and I could add many more specimens of it, if space would permit. They are made to believe that God made them slaves, that they are always to remain slaves, and bear with patience and humility the unjust punishment they receive on earth, that it may be to their glory hereafter. Is it not an unpardonable sin for man thus to defile the holy sanctuary, and pollute the sacred word of God by using it for such base purposes? But comment is unnecessary; the diabolical facts show fairly enough of themselves, without my attempting to bring them out any more. The cut represents a number of slaves listening to preaching of this kind.      
     and one looked like the Son of God. O, how Aunt Jane used to love to read about the Hebrew children!              I finally got religion, and it was Aunt Jane's praying and singing them old Virginia hymns that helped me so much. Aunt Jane's marster would let her come to see me sometimes, but not often. Sometimes she would slip away from her place at night and come to see me anyhow. She would hold prayer-meeting in my house whenever she would come to see me.               Would your marster allow you to hold prayer-meeting on his place?               No, my child; if old marster heard us singing and praying he would come out and make us stop. One time, I remember, we all were having a prayer-meeting in my cabin, and marster came up to the door and hollered out,  'You, Charlotte,  what's all that fuss in there?' We all had to hush up for that night. I was so afraid old marster would see Aunt Jane. I knew Aunt Jane would have to suffer if her white people knew she was off at night. Marster used to say God was tired of us all hollering to him at night.                       Did any of the black people on his place believe in the teachings of their master?               No, my child; none of us listened to him about singing and praying. I tell you we used to have some good times together praying and singing. He did not want us to pray, but we would have our little prayer-meeting anyhow. Sometimes when we met to hold our meetings we would put a big wash-tub full of water in the middle of the floor to catch the sound of our voices when we sung. When we all sung we would march around and shake each other's hands, and we would sing easy and low, so marster could not hear us. O, how happy I used to be in those meetings, although I was a slave! I thank the Lord Aunt Jane Lee lived by me. She helped me to make my peace with the Lord. O, the day I was converted! It seemed to me it was a paradise here below! It looked like I wanted nothing any more. Jesus was so sweet to my soul! Aunt Jane used to sing, 'Jesus! the name that charms our fears.' That hymn just suited my case. Sometimes I felt like preaching myself. It seemed I wanted to ask every body if they loved Jesus when I first got converted. I wanted to ask          old marster, but he was Creole, and did not understand what I said much. Aunt Jane was the cause of so many on our plantation getting religion. We did not have any church to go to, but she would talk to us about old Virginia, how people done there. She said them beads and crosses we saw every body have was nothing. She said people must give their hearts to God, to love him and keep his commandments; and we believed what she said. I never wanted them beads I saw others have, for I just thought we would pray without any thing, and that God only wanted the heart.        
      after, He try my faith very strong.  My master who owned me at that time having no knowledge of God or godliness, supposed my religion was all a fancy, and said he could and would whip it out of me. He took me up and tie me, and scourged me until feeling of flesh was almost gone. At length I fall I before him and lift up my cries to heaven, and ask my great Creator  What have I done?   My master cursed me, and said:  Will you preach to me?  But I now feel glad that I could  suffer patiently for my new Master. And my manner at that time take master's strength away; and before he left me he untie me and let me off. But in about three hours he come again, and threaten me with fresh scourging. And though I was very weak from the beating I got, the Lord make me feel very strong, and this prepare me to answer:  You have whipped out all fear, and  I am not afraid of you no more.  You can take a gun and shoot me  or kill me, as you please, and all for nothing; and  that is all you can do: for I know I have a life you cannot  touch, and the fear of you will not keep me from doing  anything my new Master tells me to do. And if He let you take this poor bruised body of flesh, I feel it ain't worth much;    and I feel strength to say something like this:  Thy will, O God! be done, and not mine!  After this my old master was conquered, and never whip me again, and left me in the hands of Jehovah. This give me confidence to talk to the white or the black folks, and tell what the Lord had done for my poor soul. After this a great many come to me about religion, some good and some bad folks: for it was generally known that a great change had come over Tom. But I feel so poor, sometimes,  I have to wait      
      CHAPTER II.              A fruitless effort for education.--The Sabbath among Slaves.-- Degrading amusements.--Why religion is rejected.--Condition of poor white people.--Superstition among slaves.--Education forbidden.              IN 1833, I had some very serious religious impressions, and there was quite a number of slaves in that neighborhood, who felt very desirous to be taught to read the Bible. There was a Miss Davis, a poor white girl, who offered to teach a Sabbath School for the slaves, notwithstanding public opinion and the law was opposed to it. Books were furnished and she commenced the school; but the news soon got to our owners that she was teaching us to read. This caused quite an excitement in the neighborhood. Patrols  *               *Police peculiar to the South.    were appointed to go and break it up the next Sabbath. They were determined that we should not have a Sabbath School in operation. For slaves this was called an incendiary Movement.             The Sabbath is not regarded by a large number of the slaves as a day of rest. They have no schools to go to; no moral nor religious instruction at all in many localities where there are hundreds of    
    The owner of the missing animal, however, having heard something to make him suspect what had become of his property, came rushing into the house of the man who had just eaten of the stolen food, and in a very  excited manner demanded reparation from him for the beast which his slaves had stolen; and the villain, rising from the table where he had just been eating of the stolen property, said, my servants know no more about your stolen hog than I do, which indeed was perfectly true, and the loser of the swine went away without saying  any more; but although the master of this slave with whom we were talking, had told him that it was no sin to steal from others, my brother took good care to let him know, before we separated, that it was as much a sin in the sight of God to steal from the one as the other,  Oh , said the master,  niggers has nothing to do with God,  and indeed the whole feature of slavery is so utterly inconsistent with the principles of religion, reason, and humanity, that it is no wonder that the very mention of the word God grates upon the ear as if it  typefied  the degeneracy of this hellish system.                                  Nor let the offences of their hand,                           Within thy book recorded stand.                             There's not a sparrow or a worm                           O'erlooked in thy decrees,      
    I did not then know precisely what was the cause of these scenes, for I could not get any very satisfactory information concerning the matter from my master, only that some of the slaves had undertaken to kill their owners; but I have since learned that it was the famous Nat Turner's insurrection that caused all the excitement I witnessed. Slaves were whipped, hung, and cut down with swords in the streets, if found away from their quarters after dark. The whole city was in the utmost confusion and dismay; and a dark cloud of terrific blackness, seemed to hang over the heads of the whites. So true is it, that  the wicked flee when no man pursueth.  Great numbers of the slaves were locked in the prison, and many were  half hung,  as it was termed; that is, they were suspended to some limb of a tree, with a rope about their necks, so adjusted as not to quite strangle them, and then they were pelted by the men and boys with rotten eggs. This half-hanging is a refined species of cruelty, peculiar to slavery, I believe.            Among the cruelties occasioned by this insurrection, which was however some distance from Richmond, was the forbidding of as many as five slaves to meet together, except they were at work, and the silencing of all colored preachers. One of that class in our city, refused to obey the imperial mandate, and was severely whipped; but his religion was too deeply rooted to be thus driven from him, and no promise could be extorted from his resolute soul, that he would not proclaim what he considered the glad tidings of the gospel. (Query. How many white preachers would continue their employment, if they were served in the same way?) It is strange that more insurrections do          not take place among the slaves; but their masters have impressed upon their minds so forcibly the fact, that the United States Government is pledged to put them down, in case they should attempt any such movement, that they have no heart to contend against such fearful odds; and yet the slaveholder lives in constant dread of such an event.  *               * In proof of this, I would state that during my residence at the South, a whole town was once thrown into an uproar by my entering a slave hut, about Christmas time, and talking and praying with the inmates about an hour. I was told that it would not be safe for me to remain in the town over night. C. S.               The rustling of       ----the lightest leaf,         fills his timid soul with visions of flowing blood and burning dwellings; and as the loud thunder of heaven rolls over his head, and the vivid lightning flashes across his pale face, straightway his imagination conjures up terrible scenes of the loud roaring of an enemy's cannon, and the fierce yells of an infuriated slave population, rushing to vengeance.  **                **  While at the South, a gentleman came one day to a friend of mine, and in a very excited manner said to him,  Why, are you not afraid to have that man about you? Do you not fear that your house will be burned? I cannot sleep nights lest the slaves should rise and burn all before them.  C. S.    There is no doubt but this would be the case, if it were not for the Northern people, who are ready, as I have been often told, to shoot us down, if we attempt to rise and obtain our freedom. I believe that if the slaves could do as they wish, they would throw off their heavy yoke immediately, by rising against their masters; but ten millions of Northern people stand with their feet on     
      was to have everybody converted. My desire to learn increased,  and especially, did I want a thorough acquaintance with the contents of the Bible. I have gathered scattered pages of the Bible from the filthy street-gutters, and washed and dried them, that in moments of leisure I might get a word or two of wisdom from them. While thus religiously seeking knowledge, I became acquainted with a good old  colored man named Lawson. This man not only prayed three times a day, but he prayed as he walked through the streets, at his work, on his dray--everywhere. His life was a life of prayer, and his words when he spoke to any one, were about a better world. Uncle Lawson lived near Master Hugh's house, and becoming deeply attached to him, I went often with him to prayer-meeting, and spent much of my leisure time with him on Sunday. The old man could read a little, and I was a great help to him in making out the hard words, for I was a better reader than he. I could teach him  the letter,  but he could teach me  the spirit,  and refreshing times we had together, in singing and praying. These meetings went on for a long time without the knowledge of Master Hugh or my mistress. Both knew, however, that I had become religious, and seemed to respect my conscientious piety. My mistress was still a professor of religion, and belonged to class. Her leader was no less a person than Rev. Beverly Waugh, the presiding elder, and afterwards one of the bishops of the Methodist Episcopal church.             In view of the cares and anxieties incident to the life she was leading, and especially in view of the separation from religious associations to which she was subjected, my mistress had, as I have before stated, become lukewarm, and needed to be looked up by her leader. This often brought Mr. Waugh to our house, and gave me an opportunity to hear him exhort and pray. But my chief instructor in religious matters was Uncle Lawson. He was my spiritual father and I loved him intensely, and was at his house every chance I could get. This pleasure, however, was not long unquestioned. Master           Hugh became averse to our intimacy, and threatened to whip me if I ever went there again. I now felt myself persecuted by a wicked man, and I  would  go. The good old man had told me that the  Lord had a great work for me to do,  and I must prepare to do it; that he had been shown that I must preach the gospel. His words made a very deep impression upon me, and I verily felt that some such work was before me, though I could not see how I could ever engage in its performance.  The good Lord would bring it to pass in his own good time,  he said, and that I must go on reading and studying the scriptures. This advice and these suggestions were not without their influence on my character and destiny. He fanned my already intense love of knowledge into a flame by assuring me that I was to be a useful man in the world. When I would say to him,  How can these things be? and what can I do?  his simple reply, was,   Trust in the Lord .  When I would tell him,  I am a slave, and a slave for life, how can I do anything?  he would quietly answer,  The  Lord  can make you free, my dear; all things are possible with Him; only have  faith  in God.'Ask, and it shall be given you.' If you want liberty, ask the Lord for it  in  FAITH,  and he will give it to you .              Thus assured and thus cheered on under the inspiration of hope, I worked and prayed with a light heart, believing that my life was under the guidance of a wisdom higher than my own. With all other blessings sought at the mercy seat, I always prayed that God would, of his great mercy and in his own good time, deliver me from my bondage.             I went, one day, on the wharf of Mr. Waters, and seeing two Irishmen unloading a scow of stone or ballast, I went on board unasked, and helped them. When we had finished the work one of the men came to me, aside, and asked me a number of questions, and among them if I were a slave? I told him  I was a slave for life.  The good Irishman gave a shrug, and seemed deeply affected. He said it was a pity so fine a little fellow as I was should be a slave for life. They both had much to say about the matter, and expressed the     
    professor of religion, and belonged to class. Her leader was no less a person than Rev. Beverly Waugh, the presiding elder, and afterwards one of the bishops of the Methodist Episcopal church.            In view of the cares and anxieties incident to the life she was leading, and especially in view of the separation from religious associations to which she was subjected, my mistress had, as I have before stated, become lukewarm, and needed to be looked up by her leader. This often brought Mr. Waugh to our house, and gave me an opportunity to hear him exhort and pray. But my chief instructor in religious matters was Uncle Lawson.

   my mistress. Both knew, however, that I had become religious, and they seemed to respect my conscientious piety. My mistress was still a professor of religion, and belonged to class. Her leader was no less a person than the Rev. Beverly Waugh, the presiding elder, and now one of the bishops of the Methodist Episcopal church. Mr. Waugh was then stationed over Wilk street church. I am careful to state these facts, that the reader may be able to form an idea of the precise influences which had to do with shaping and directing my mind.           In view of the cares and anxieties incident to the life she was then leading, and, especially, in view of the separation from religious associations to which she was subjected, my mistress had, as I have before stated, become lukewarm, and needed to be looked up by her leader.

He was my spiritual father; and I loved him intensely, and was at his house every chance I got.           This pleasure was not long allowed me. Master Hugh became averse to my going to Father Lawson's, and threatened to whip me if I ever went there again. I now felt myself persecuted by a wicked man; and I  would  go to Father Lawson's, notwithstanding the threat. The good old man had told me, that the  Lord had a great work for me to do;  and I must prepare to do it; and that he had been shown that I must preach the gospel. His words made a deep impression on my mind, and I verily felt that some such     
      I arose. It proved to be a watchman. The sisters became so frightened, they all went away except the one who lived in the house, and an old woman; they both appeared to be much frightened, fearing they should receive some personal injury, or be put out of the house. A feeling of weakness came over me for a short time, but I soon grew warm and courageous in the Spirit. The man then said to me,  I was sent here to break up your meeting. Complaint has been made to me that the people round here cannot sleep for the racket.  I replied,  a good racket is better than a bad racket. How do they rest when the ungodly are dancing and fiddling till midnight? Why are not they molested by the watchmen? and why should we be for praising God, our Maker? Are we worthy of greater punishment for praying to Him? and are we to be prohibited from doing so, that sinners may remain slumbering in their sins?  While speaking these few words I grew warm with  heavenly  zeal, and laid my hand upon him and addressed him with gospel truth,  how do sinners sleep in hell, after slumbering in their sins here, and crying, 'let me rest, let me rest,' while sporting on the very brink of hell? Is the cause of God to be destroyed for this purpose?   Speaking several words more to this amount, he turned pale and trembled, and begged my pardon, acknowledging that it was not his wish to interrupt us, and that           he would never disturb a religious assembly again. He then took leave of me in a comely manner and wished us success. After he was gone, I turned to the old sisters who by this time were quite cheered up. You see, said I, if the sisters had not fled, what a victory we might have had on the Lord's side; for the man seemed ready to give up under conviction. If it had not been for their cowardice, we might have all bowed in prayer, and a shout of victory had been heard amongst us.             Our meeting gave great offence, and we were forbid holding any more assemblies. Even the elders of our meeting joined with the wicked people, and said such meetings must be stopped, and that woman quieted. But I was not afraid of any of them, and continued to go, and burnt with a zeal not my own. The old sisters were zealous sometimes, and at other times would sink under the cross. Thus they grow cold, at which I was much grieved. I proposed to them to ask the elders to send a brother, which was concluded upon.             We went on for several years, and the Lord was with us with great power it proved, to the conversion of many souls, and we continued to grow stronger.             I felt at times that I must exercise in the ministry, but when I rose upon my feet I felt  ashmed , and so I went under a cloud for some time, and endeavoured     
   under the ground in Southampton County. He was an exhorter early, and had acquired great influence over the slaves, and this he used to incite them, to combine and to murder their masters and their families, and thus free themselves from slavery. Several whole families were sacrificed to this horrid and cruel infatuation 'ere its leaders were discovered, and severe retribution was dealt to all supposed to have knowledge of the plot. John was seized by the city guard, being out after eight o'clock, and thrown into prison, but being recognized by the captain, to whom he was taken, and his good faith proved, he was returned unharmed to his master's domains.           The State Government soon after enacted a law prohibiting colored men entirely from preaching and exhorting, or even gathering for prayer meetings, except at the leaves of their respective owners. These were hard laws to submit to, their situation as slaves being made bearable to some only by the soothing counsels and influence of their christian brethren. But the moral courage of a few of the preachers rose superior to the laws of the land, when they were in violation of the laws of God as revealed in the Scriptures. Among such men was one Pleasant Randall, the property of Mr. Harrison, of Charles City, who deemed his commission to make the Gospel known to sinners, to be from the Lord, and not from man.           When gone into Prince George County, one Saturday, to preach for a couple of days, the planters in the vicinity visited his master, Mr. Harrison, urging him to restrain Randall, or shut him up, saying, that his preaching so affected their people that they would bear beating and beating, and then hear him again at the first opportunity--they could not thus spare their time, and the man ought, by the laws, to be hung--and  they  should do something to        stop him, if he did not. Mr. Harrison was personally attached to the good man, and told them, that no  mob  should touch him; they must proceed according to law if they meant to hinder his preaching. So Randall was arrested, imprisoned, and tried, and convicted, and condemned to be hung, for making eternal salvation known to his fellows, and an early day was fixed for his execution.           At this conclusion of the matter, Mr. H. went to Richmond to obtain from the Governor, if possible, his reprieve.           The Governor said it was a trying case, truly, but he must see, he supposed, to the execution of the laws of the State of which he was governor.           Mr. Harrison continued to plead for him, extolling his true piety, and many noble qualities. Finally, the Governor said,  Bring him to me, I want to see him,  and he forthwith prepared the document for summoning him.--The doors of the Richmond jail opened at the command of the Governor, and a guard attending the devoted culprit, was brought into Magisterial presence.            So you are the man that won't stop preaching,  said the Governor to Randall.  Yes, massa,  he replied,  I mean to preach as long as the Lord God gives me breath.   Can you preach,  the Governor again interrogated.  Yes, massa, I can, the Lord sent me to preach, and helps me.   Well, let us hear you, then,  said he, thinking, perhaps, to have some merriment. He took for his text,  The earth is the Lord's,  and preached an hour before his Excellency, who was in no light mood when the discourse was ended, and a fervent prayer had been offered in his behalf to the Lord of Heaven and earth. Gov. C. sent him out of the room, and said to Mr. H-- It is a shame to hang such a man. It would be a scandal to Virginia. I cannot do it,     
   I know nothing of the others, nor am I likely ever to hear of them again.          The treatment of slaves is mildest near the borders, where the free and slave states join: it becomes more severe, the further we go from the free states. It is more severe in the west and south than where I lived. The sale of slaves most frequently takes place from the milder to the severer parts: in that directtion,  there is great traffic in slaves, which is carried on by the speculators. On the frontier between the slave and free states there is a guard; no coloured person can go over a ferry without a pass. By these regulations, and the great numbers of patrols, escape is made very difficult.          Formerly slaves were allowed to have religious  meetings of their own; but after the insurrection which I spoke of before, they were forbidden to meet even for worship. Often they are flogged, if they are found singing or praying at home. They may go to the places of worship used by the whites; but they like their own meetings better. My wife's brother Isaac        was a coloured preacher. A number of slaves went privately into the wood to hold meetings; when they were found out, they were flogged, and each was forced to tell who else was there. Three were shot, two of whom were killed, and the other was badly wounded. For preaching to them, Isaac was flogged, and his back pickled; when he was nearly well, he was flogged and pickled again, and so on for some months; then his back was suffered to get well, and he was sold. A little while before this, his wife was sold away with an infant at her breast; and of his six children,  four had been sold away by one at a time. On the way with his buyers he dropped down dead; his heart was broken.          Having thus narrated what has happened to myself, my relatives, and near friends, I will add a few matters about slaves and coloured persons in general.          Slaves are under fear in every word they speak. If in their master's kitchen they let slip an expression of discontent, or a wish for freedom, it is often reported to the master or mistress by the children of the family, who may     
   Master administered such punishment as he thought best. The punishment was a certain number of lashes from the whip for the first offence and more if the offence was repeated, with the addition of an iron weight tied to their backs for a number of days or weeks according to the Master's pleasure, these weights to be carried during the day while they were at work.           The year of which we are writing, about two hundred slaves were gathered on the stock farm, and in the fall most of them were marched off to the several slave markets in the same manner as before described, fastened to a long chain with the women who could walk following, and the women and children not able to walk in wagons. Of the two hundred, 170 were taken, leaving thirty to run the farm and do the winter work. This lot was taken to Bardstown, thence to Louisville, where they were put aboard of boats rigged with stalls similar to horse stalls into which the slaves were placed and chained until they reached Vicksburg or other places where markets were held.           On this trip Rosa accompanied the Master, and his wife was left on the farm to attend to matters there. His wife was a devout Catholic, and while Master was gone she used to gather the slaves remaining, each morning in her dining room and teach them prayers and some of the younger ones she taught to read. When the Master returned in the spring and learned what she had been doing he was very angry. He had always told his  slaves that he was their Lord and Master, and now informed them his wife should not have told them of any other Lord. From Rosa we learned that he lectured his wife for her conduct about as follows:  If you teach them to pray and read they may think they are human beings and we will not be able to keep them as slaves; the more ignorant we        keep them about such things the better slaves they are. The worst slaves we have are those who know the most, they are the ones we have to punish to keep them down. We have here from twenty to two hundred slaves each year, and if they should know as much as we do, where would we be? They would murder us in spite of the law. After this, my dear wife, you must never teach a negro the Lord's prayer, or any other prayer.            After the above there was no more gathering for prayers, and the little prayer book she had distributed among us and the little primers she had given were taken from us by Rosa, she saying:  The Master says you do not need them.  Thus we soon lost what little we had learned, except, for some reason, the Lord's prayer, so simple and yet so full of meaning and comfort, was quite generally remembered. It has always seemed to me that there was some Divine help in this. That little prayer increased my wonder why we should be the slaves of the whites, and especially did I wonder in my own case when I thought of the fact that my mother was from the island of Madagascar and her people were never slaves. Why then should I be one?           After Master's lecture to his wife she had no more to do with us and the care of the slaves was turned over to Rosa who was a slave herself, and the Sunday following, Master had us all seated on the ground in the yard and lectured us as follows:            You must not think hard of me for telling you the truth about yourselves and the Whites. The great God above has made you for the benefit of the Whiteman, who is your law maker and law giver. Whenever you disobey his commands you must expect punishment. Your duty is in all cases to never raise your     
      on Tuesday morning--this was Sunday night. His house was five  miles off.             Readers, just notice what I suffered as a man, and yet these trials were good for me. Col. Jones made me suffer, in his life-time, what few man have suffered. On one occasion, I submitted to let him tie and whip me. I asked him if he didn't think be he had whipped me enough.              When I am done with you it will be night,  he replied.             I did not know my strength; I flung my foot against the tree and broke loose and got away from him and the other white man, untied the knot with my teeth. I was tempted to kill him.             This was two years before I parted with him for good. There was a day when he would take no money for me. The first time he ever talked of selling me was when I asked him to let me have a wife on Dr. Roger's plantation. He never let me see any peace after the first four years.              Bretheren,  what a blessing it is to dwell together in the spirit. Beware how you entertain a stranger, for you may entertain an angel. Have you forgotten the life we lived when we were slaves? Our sufferings were great, and in some places we were not allowed to worship God at all. We had to have secret prayer meetings on Saturday nights, and some would have to watch for the patrolmen and hard task-masters, to keep from being surprised, while the others prayed and sung. When the enemy was seen the watch would give the alarm; we would then close the meeting and make our escape, in order to keep our backs from being slashed and salted down.             In Marsh county, N. C., we had a noble speaker by the name of Minger Crudemp; he was the slave of a popular Baptist Minister, who, although he was a preacher, did not allow his slaves to worship the God he praised. This Minger Crudemp would hold prayer-meetings every Saturday night that he had a chance in spite of the penalty he would have to pay if he was caught; they would run him Saturday and Sunday.  Bretheren , see how hard it was for us so serve God in the days of slavery. In some places they were allowed to praise God, but they had to have a white man to watch them. (When I was a small boy Bethey Thompson, a religious woman, was whipped by her mistress because she would pray and shout through the day.) Oh, how hard were the lives we led in those days. It was a common thing for slave men and women to run away into the woods to keep their masters from whipping them. To day,  bretheren , we ought to love one another and be the best friends and citizens in America. Just look at the mercy of God in the midst of all the Presidents during slavery; yet we were held in bondage. God reared up Abraham Lincoln--one whom the people had not looked for--who used more power than any of the men in America. He caused the  shackels  to be thrown off the bondmen.             There are few of you who have ever thought what it cost to set you free--hundreds and thousands of lives were lost; even our greatest man, Abraham Lincoln, fell. No other man did the will of God as he did; it seemed as if he was intended to liberate us. He arose     
           While Rachel was putting on the sweet oil my master  came in, and I could hear mistress scolding him for  giving me such an inhuman beating, when I had done  nothing. He said in reply, that Tom was an obstinate  liar, and that was the reason why he had whipped me.          But I got well of my mangled back, and my book  was still left. This was my best, my constant friend.  With great eagerness, I snatched every moment I  could get, morning, noon and night, for study. I had  begun to read; and, oh, how I loved to study, and to  dwell on the thoughts which I gained from reading.  About this time, I read a piece in my book about God.  It said that  God, who sees and knows all our thoughts,  loves the good and makes them happy; while he is  angry with the bad, and will punish them for all their  sins.  This made me feel very unhappy, because I was  sure I was not good in the sight of God. I thought  about this, and could'nt get it out of my mind a single  hour. So I went to James Galley, a colored man, who  exhorted the slaves sometimes on Sunday, and told him  my trouble, asking,  what shall I do?  He told me  about Jesus, and told me I must pray the Lord to forgive  me and help me to be good and happy. So I  went home, and went down cellar and prayed, but I  found no relief, no comfort for my unhappy mind. I  felt so bad that I could not study my book. My master  saw that I looked very unhappy, and he asked me  what ailed me. I did not dare  now  to tell a lie, for I  wanted to be good, that I might be happy. So I told  my master just how it was with me; and then he swore  terribly at me, and said he would whip me if I did not  give over praying. He said there was no heaven and  no hell, and that Christians were all hypocrites, and  that there was nothing after this life, and that he would  not permit me to go moping round, praying and going  to the meetings. I told him I could not help praying,  and then he cursed me in a great passion, and declared  he would whip me if he knew of my going on any more  in that foolish way. The next night I was to a meeting,           which was led by Jack Cammon,a free colored  man, and a class leader in the Methodist Church. I  was so much overcome by my feelings, that I staid very  late. They prayed for me, but I did not yet find any  relief; I was still very unhappy. The next morning,  my master came in, and asked me if I went the night  before to the meeting. I told him the truth. He  said, didn't I tell you I would whip you if you went  nigh these meetings, and did n't I tell you to stop this  foolish praying?  I told him he did, and if he would,  why, he might whip me, but still I could not stop praying,  because I wanted to be good, that I might be happy  and go to heaven. This reply made my master  very angry. With many bitter oaths, he said he had  promised me a whipping, and now he should be as good  as his word. And so he was. He whipped me, and  then forbade, with bitter threatenings, my praying any  more, and especially my going again to meeting. This  was Friday morning. I continued to pray for comfort  and peace. The next Sunday I went to meeting. The  minister preached a sermon on being born again, from  the words of Jesus to Nicodemus. All this alone  deepened my trouble of mind. I returned home very  unhappy. Collins, a free man of color, was at the  meeting, and told my master that I was there. So, on  Monday morning my master whipped me again, and  once more forbade my going to meetings and praying.  The next Sunday there was a class meeting, led by  Binney Pennison, a colored free man. I asked my  master, towards night, if I might go out. I told him I  did not feel well. I wanted to go to the class meeting.  Without asking me  where  I was going, he said I might  go. I went to the class. I staid very late, and I was  so overcome by my feelings, that I could not go home  that night. So they carried me to Joseph Jones' cabin,  a slave of Mr. Jones. Joseph talked and prayed with  me nearly all night. In the morning I went home as  soon as it was light, and, for fear of master, I asked  Nancy, one of the slaves, to go into mistress's room       and get the store key for me, that I might go and open  the store. My master told her to go back and tell me  to come up. I obeyed with many fears. My master  asked me where I had been the night before. I told  him the whole truth. He cursed me again, and said he  should whip me for my obstinate disobedience; and he  declared he would kill me if I did not promise to obey  him. He refused to listen to my mistress, who was a  professor, and who tried to intercede for me. And,  just as soon as he had finished threatening me with  what he would do, he ordered me to take the key and  go and open the store. When he came into the store  that morning, two of his neighbors, Julius Dumbiven, and McCauslin, came in too. He called me up and asked  me again where I staid last night. I told him with  his boy, Joseph. He said he knew that was a lie; and  he immediately sent off for Joseph to confirm his suspicions.  He ordered me to strip off my clothes, and,  as I did so, he took down the cow-hide, heavy and stiff  with blood which he had before drawn from my body  with that cruel weapon, and which was congealed upon  it. Dumbiven professed to be a Christian, and he now  came forward, and earnestly interceded for me, but to  no purpose, and then he left. McCauslin asked my  master, if he did not know that a slave was worth  more money after he became pious than he was before.  And why then, he said, should you forbid Tom going  to meetings and praying? He replied, that religion  was all a damned mockery, and he was not going to  have any of his slaves praying and whining round  about their souls. McCauslin then left. Joseph came  and told the same story about the night before that I  had done; and then he began to beg master not to  whip me. He cursed him and drove him off. He then  whipped me with great severity, inflicting terrible pain  at every blow upon my quivering body, which was still  very tender from recent lacerations. My suffering was  so great, that it seemed to me I should die. He paused  at length, and asked me would I mind him and stop       praying. I told him I could not promise him not to  pray any more, for I felt that I must and should pray  as long as I lived.  Well, then, Tom,  he said,  I  swear that I will whip you to death.  I told him I  could not help myself, if he was determined to kill me,  but that  I must pray while I lived.  He then began to  whip me the second time, but soon stopped, threw down  the bloody cowhide, and told me to go wash myself in  the river, just back of the store, and then dress myself,  and if I was determined to be a fool, why, I must be  one. My mistress now interceded earnestly for me  with my cruel master. The next Sabbath was love  feast, and I felt very anxious to join in that feast. This  I could not do without a paper from my master, and so  I asked mistress to help me. She advised me to be  patient, and said she would help me all she could.  Master refused to give any paper, and so I could not  join in the love feast the next day.          On the next Friday evening, I went to the prayer  meeting. Jack Cammon was there, and opened the  meeting with prayer. Then Binney Pennison gave  out the sweet hymn, which begins in these words:    Come ye sinners, poor and needy,  Weak and wounded, sick and sore.             I felt that it all  applied most sweetly to my condition,  and I said in my heart,  I  will come  now  to Jesus, and   trust  in him. So when those who felt anxious were  requested to come forward and kneel within the altar  for prayer,  I  came and knelt down. While Jacob  Cammon was praying for me, and for those who knelt  by my side, my burden of sorrow, which had so long  weighed me down, was removed. I felt the glory of  God's love warming my heart, and making me very  happy. I shouted aloud for joy, and tried to tell all  my poor slave brothers and sisters, who were in the  house, what a dear Saviour I had found, and how happy  I felt in his precious love. Binney Pennison asked me  if I could forgive my master. I told him I could, and       
      then went out, and I got my book and hid it safely away before he came in again. When I went to the house, my wounds had dried and I was in an agony of pain. My mistress told the servant girl, Rachel, to help me off with my shirt, and to wash my wounds for me, and to put on to them some sweet oil. The shirt was dried to my back, so that it could not be got off without tearing off some of the skin with it. The pain, upon doing this, was greater even than I had endured from my cruel whipping. After Rachel had got my shirt off, my mistress asked me what I had done for which my master had whipped me so severely. I told her he had accused me of stealing when I had not, and then had whipped me to make me own it.             While Rachel was putting on the sweet oil, my master came in, and I could hear mistress scolding him for giving me such an inhuman beating, when I had done nothing. He said in reply, that Tom was an obstinate liar, and that was the reason why he had whipped me.             But I got well of my mangled back, and my book was as still left. This was my best, my constant friend. With great eagerness,  I snatched every moment I could get, morning, noon, and night, for study. I had begun to read; and, Oh, how I loved to study, and to dwell on the thoughts which I gained from my reading. About this time, I read a piece in my book about God. It said that  God, who sees and knows all our thoughts, loves the good and makes them happy; while he is angry with the bad, and will punish them for all their sins.  This made me feel very  unhapdy , because I was sure that I was not good in the sight of God. I thought about this, and couldn't get it out of my mind a single hour. So I went to James Galley, a colored man, who exhorted the slaves sometimes on Sunday, and told him my trouble, asking,  what shall I do?  He told me about Jesus, and told me I must pray the Lord to forgive me and help me to be good and happy.

He whipped me, and then forbade, with bitter threatenings, my praying any more, and especially my going again to meeting. This was Friday morning. I continued to pray for comfort and peace. The next Sunday I went to meeting. The minister preached a sermon on being born again, from the words of Jesus  to Nicodemus. All this only deepened my trouble of mind. I returned home very unhappy.

He replied, that religion was all a damned mockery, and he was not going to have any of his slaves praying and whining round about their souls. McCauslin then left. Joseph came and told the same story about the night before that I had done, and then began to beg master not to whip me. He cursed him and drove him off. He then whipped me with great severity, inflicting terrible pain at every blow upon my quivering body which was still very tender from recent lacerations.

This I could not do without a paper from my master, and so I asked mistress to help me. She advised me to be patient, and said she would help me all she could. Master refused to give any paper, and so I could not join the loving feast the next day.             On the next Friday evening, I went to the prayer meeting. Jack Cammon was there, and opened the meeting with prayer. Then Binney Pennison gave out the sweet hymn, which begins in these words:      Come ye sinners poor and needy,         
  get through all right. In a short time afterwards she received   the witness of the Holy Spirit that her sins were all forgiven.   She was then a happy girl. She knew that her sins were all   washed away by the blood of Jesus. She could sing this song:                                          Oh! happy day, that fixed my choice,                                       On Thee, my Savior and my God;                                         Well may this glowing heart rejoice,                                      And tell its rapture all abroad.                                         Happy day! Happy day!                                       When Jesus washed my sins away.                                       He taught me how to watch and pray,                                      And live rejoicing every day,                                       Happy day! Happy day!                                       When Jesus washed my sins away.            The meeting spread  from one plantation to another, and   many of the poor slaves' hearts were made to rejoice, for the   Lord Jesus visited them, notwithstanding they were treated   only as cattle and horses. Thanks be unto the Lord God of   Heaven, who did look down upon them in their helpless condition  in tender mercy.           The subject of this sketch was a faithful young Christian,   laboring in the prayer meetings from house to house. They did   not have churches of their own. She related that one night   their prayer meeting continued until daylight, the power of   God having fallen upon the people in such a wonderful manner   that they fell on the floor like dead men and women. Many   of them had to go one, two and three miles to their homes, and   some of them were greatly punished for being away from their   houses at that late hour of night, for most all of them were,          compelled to go to work before daylight. But in spite of all   this cruel treatment they would pray and sing so that it would   disturb their old masters so that they could not sleep and they   would whip them, but still the poor slaves would continue to   serve the Lord.          Our subject said that one of the masters in that part of   Kentucky, a cruel slave holder whose name we can not recall,   had a slave (a man) by  the name of Dick, who was a true man   of God. His master was so bitterly opposed to his serving the   Lord as not to even permit him to return thanks at the table   before taking his meals. But Dick had settled the matter, and   the more his master would punish him the more he would pray   for his master.  At length his prevailing prayer with his God   was the salvation of his master, and he was converted in a   wonderful manner at a camp meeting.  Dick was present, and   his master ran to him, threw his arms around him and took   him up and carried him around in the camp ground. After his    conversion he set Dick free, and, giving him a horse, saddle   and bridle, told  him to go and preach the gospel everywhere.   He also set free all the rest of  his slaves. Oh, it is wonderful how God can use a man. This is true        
      immortality of man, while in the flesh: Praying Jacob. This man was a slave in the State of Maryland. His master was very cruel to his slaves. Jacob's rule was to pray three times a day, at just such an hour of the day; no matter what his work was or where he might be, he would stop and go and pray. His master has been to him and pointed his gun at him, and told him if he did not cease praying he would blow out his brains. Jacob would finish his prayer and then tell his master to shoot in welcome--your loss will be my gain--I have two masters, one on earth and one in heaven --master Jesus in heaven, and master Saunders on earth. I have a soul and a body; the body belongs to you, master Saunders, and the soul to master Jesus. Jesus says men ought always to pray, but you will not pray, neither do you want to have me pray. This man said in private conversation that several times he went home and drank an unusual           quantity of brandy to harden his heart that he might kill him; but he never had power to strike nor shoot him, and he would freely give the world, if he had it in his possession for what he believed his Jacob to possess. He also thought that Jacob was as sure of Heaven as the apostle Paul or Peter. Sometimes Mr. S. would be in the field about half drunk, raging like a madman, whipping the other slaves; and when Jacob's hour would come for prayer, he would stop his horses and plough and kneel down and pray; but he could not strike the man of God.             The first Methodist minister that ever preached. in a certain town in Queen Ann's county, there was a great revival of religion among the rich and poor, black and white, free and slaves. When many of them experienced religion they would disobey their ungodly masters and would go to meetings nights and Sundays. Two rich slaveholders waylaid the           minister at night, and taking him off from his horse and beat him until they thought he was dead. But the Lord saved his life to preach his Word, and many were converted in the same town through his preaching, and many masters, when converted, set their slaves free.             My grandmother died at ninety years of age; my mother at seventy, and my father at eighty years of age. These three friends died in the strongest triumph of faith in Jesus, who when on earth said he would be with his people to the end of the world. Amen.             Perhaps some person will ask why did I teach the art of wrestling, boxing and fighting, when desirous to learn to read the Bible? I answer because no one is so contemptible as a coward. With us a coward is looked upon as the most degraded wretch on earth, and is only worthy to be a slave. My brother's master, Governor R. Right, of Maryland, taught his children never to take an insult from one of     
           On Sunday nights, a slave, named Allen, used to come to Mr. Gooch's estate for the purpose of exhorting and praying with his brother slaves, by whose instrumentality many of them had been converted.  One evening Mr. Gooch caught them all in a room, turned Allen out, and threatened his slaves with a hundred lashes each, if they ever brought him there again.  At one time Mr. Gooch was ill and confined to his room; if any of the slaves had done any thing which he thought deserving a flogging, he would have them brought into his bed-room and flogged before his eyes.          With respect to food, he used to allow us one peck of Indian meal each, per week, which, after being sifted and the bran taken from it, would not be much more than half a peck.  Meat we did not get for sometimes several weeks together; however, he was proverbial for giving his slaves more food than any other slave-holder.  I stayed with Mr. Gooch a year and a half.  During that time the scenes of cruelty I witnessed and experienced,  are not at all fitted for these pages. There is much to excite disgust in what has been narrated, but hundreds of other cases might be     
      going to work, and if not done before the overseer called them to the field, they must go without it; and often the children, being asleep at this time, were of course obliged to go without their breakfast.             The slaves' clothing was, in winter, one shirt, pants and jacket, without lining, shoes and stockings. In summer, one shirt and one pair of pants of coarse linen.             When the tobacco is ripe, or nearly so, there are frequently worms in it, about two inches long, and as large as one's thumb. They have horns, and are called tobacco worms. They are very destructive to the tobacco crops, and must be carefully picked off by the hands, so as not to break the leaves, which are very easily broken. But careful as the slaves may be, they cannot well avoid leaving some of these worms on the plants. It was a custom of Mr. Wagar to follow after the slaves, to see if he could find any left, and if so, to compel the person in whose row they were found, to eat them. This was done to render them more careful. It may seem incredible to my readers, but it is a fact.             My mistress and her family were all Episcopalians. The nearest church was five miles from our plantation, and there was no Methodist church nearer than ten miles. So we went to the Episcopal church, but always came home as we went, for the preaching was above our comprehension, so that we could understand but little that was said. But soon the Methodist religion was brought among us, and preached in a manner so plain that the way-faring man, though a fool, could not err therein.             This new doctrine produced great consternation among           the slaveholders. It was something which they could not understand. It brought glad tidings to the poor bond-man; it bound up the broken-hearted it opened the prison doors to them that were bound, and let the captive go free.             As soon as it got among the slaves, it spread from plantation to plantation, until it reached ours, where there were but few who did not experience religion. The slaveholders, becoming much alarmed at this strange phenomenon, called a meeting, at which they appointed men to patrol the country, and break up these religious assemblies. This was done, and many a poor victim had his back severely cut, for simply going to a prayer meeting.             At length, Mr. Wagar bought at auction a man named Martin, who was a fiddler. As slaves are very fond of dancing, our master thought that fiddling would bring them back to their former ignorant condition and bought this man for that purpose. It had the desired effect upon most of them, and what the whip failed to accomplish, the fiddle completed, for it is no easy matter to drive a soul from God by cruelty, when it may easily be drawn away by worldly pleasures; and fiddling I think is better appropriated to this purpose, than anything else could mention.      CHAP. III.             MR. W. was. a very cruel slave driver. He would whip unreasonably and without cause. He was often     
     Then let this feeble body fail,              It was a hymn of many verses (I afterwards got an old woman to teach them to me); and there was such tenderness in his voice and such solemnity in his manner that I was greatly affected. When the singing was over, he moved about among the congregation; and, coming close to me, he said,  Girl, don't you want religion? don't you want to be happy when you die?  Then he asked me to promise him that, when I got home, I would go upon my knees and ask God to give me the witness that I was his. I made him no answer; but, as soon as I reached home and was alone, I knelt down, and in my feeble and ignorant way begged to be saved. From that day to this, I have been praying and trying to do as I thought my heavenly Master has required of me; and I think I have had the witness of the Spirit.           So, night after night, I went to the little school-house, and had many precious seasons. Master Jerry and Miss Sally were very kind to me, and tried to show me the way to be a Christian.           But there came a time when Master David said he was not going  to have me running to meeting all the time any longer. He had decided  to send me up to old Mr. Levers, two miles away, there to stay until  I should get over my  religious fever,  as he called it. Accordingly,  I went as directed; but, when it came night, I asked if I might go  down to Mount Asa school-house for meeting. The old         man said:  Yes. You can go; and, as it is so far away, you need not come back here till morning. But go home, and stay with the children, as you always do, and have the care of them.  I couldn't understand it, but I went; and, when in the morning Kibbler saw me, he scolded, and sent me off to Levers again. Every night, old Mr. Levers would tell me I could go; and I did, till, in the middle of the meeting one night, Master Kibbler came up to me, and, taking me by the arm, carried me out, scolding and fuming, declaring that old Webster (the minister) was a liar, and that for himself he didn't want such a  whoopin' and hollerin' religion,  and, if that was the way to heaven, he didn't  want to go there.  After this, my conscience troubled me very much about going. Mr. Levers would tell me to go; but I knew that Master David had forbidden me to do so. One night, I started out, and, as I came to a persimmon-tree, I felt moved to go down on my knees and ask the Lord to help me, and make Master David willing. In a few minutes, I felt very happy. I wanted to remain on my knees, and wished I could walk on them till I could come before Master David. I tried to do so, and was almost surprised to find I could get along so well. At last, I reached the piazza, and was able to enter the room, where I saw him sitting; and, as I did so, I said,  O Master,  may  I go to meeting?  He saw my position; and, as if  rent by the Spirit,  he cried out:  Well, I'll go to the devil if you ain't  my match!  Yes: go to meeting, and stay there.            After this, I had no trouble from this cause. When I was to be taken into the church, I asked him if he was willing, and he said:  I don't care. If that's your way of getting to heaven, I don't care. I only wish you were all there.  So I was baptized, and have been trying, in my poor way ever since to serve the Lord.      
      such time as the driver thought proper, when he would crack his whip two or three times, and they would eat their breakfasts, which consisted of strong, rancid pork, coarse corn bread, and water, which was brought to them by small children, who were not able to handle the hoe. As soon as Harry, the driver, has finished his breakfast, they finish likewise, and hang up their buckets on the fence or trees, and to work they go, without one moment's intermission until noon, when they take their dinner in the same manner as their breakfast; which done, they go again to work, continuing till dark. They then return to their cabins, and have a half hour to prepare their food for the next day, when the horn is again blown for bed. If any are found out of their cabins after this time, they are put in jail and kept till morning, when they  generally receive twenty-five or thirty lashes for their  misdemeanor. So it continues through the week until  Sunday, when the women take their tubs and blankets and start for the brooks, where they dismantle and robe themselves in their blanket, wash and dry their clothes, put them on again, and are ready to be at the house at four o'clock to receive their weekly allowance, which is weighed out to them by the overseer. The men give their shirts to the women to wash, and take their baskets or hoes and start for the field. The are generally paid for this extra work; if they do not work, they are set  down as lazy persons, and are whipped because they will not work for themselves. Thus is the Sabbath passed. That day of rest and prayer is as other days to the poor slave. For six years whilst I was on this farm, there was never such a thing as a slave going to meeting, or  hearing the word of God in any form.      
   this man whatever he wants to eat and drink, and I will pay it.  Then the landlord turned to me and said,  I will give you seventy-five dollars a month if you will act as porter for me.  I assured him that I would do so. The colored men I left behind, who came on the ship the same time, I met at the door. I said to them,  Give me your names, gentlemen; also your baggage.  Say they,  Get out; where is the landlord?   Give me your baggage, and just walk into the sitting-room.  But they still refused to do so. I then called the attention of the landlord, who said,  Give your baggage to this man, for he is the porter, and he is the proper representative to take care of it;  which of course made me walk as though I owned all the house. You remember just the night before I had nowhere to lay my head; and being raised from that situation to the porterage of one of the finest hotels in Panama, it was a large jump. Reader, do you not think I should have been grateful for such a great beneficent benefactor? How I should strive to render due gratitude unto Him: I should say with the poet--                At supper time I rang the bell, and they all came down to supper, the passengers looking upon me with much astonishment. One of them, of dark hue, who had not treated me with the respect he ought to have done, said,  Hallo, Williams, how is it that you have got to be porter here?  This was done to blandish me. I then thought it was my time to treat him with the same contempt that he had treated me with on the boat. This you know was wrong; it was not doing as my Bible taught me. I once heard of a little girl who read her Bible, and gave proof that she was governed by its precepts. The facts were these: she had been to school; on her way home she met with a little girl who always made it a point to push her out of the path. This day it pleased her teacher to give Emma, for that was her name, a great many bunches of grapes, and on her way home, as usual, she came in contact with the other little girl, and she gave this same little girl some of them. Going home     
      after, He try my faith very strong.  My master who owned me at that time having no knowledge of God or godliness, supposed my religion was all a fancy, and said he could and would whip it out of me. He took me up and tie me, and scourged me until feeling of flesh was almost gone. At length I fall I before him and lift up my cries to heaven, and ask my great Creator  What have I done?   My master cursed me, and said:  Will you preach to me?  But I now feel glad that I could  suffer patiently for my new Master. And my manner at that time take master's strength away; and before he left me he untie me and let me off. But in about three hours he come again, and threaten me with fresh scourging. And though I was very weak from the beating I got, the Lord make me feel very strong, and this prepare me to answer:  You have whipped out all fear, and  I am not afraid of you no more.  You can take a gun and shoot me  or kill me, as you please, and all for nothing; and  that is all you can do: for I know I have a life you cannot  touch, and the fear of you will not keep me from doing  anything my new Master tells me to do. And if He let you take this poor bruised body of flesh, I feel it ain't worth much;    and I feel strength to say something like this:  Thy will, O God! be done, and not mine!  After this my old master was conquered, and never whip me again, and left me in the hands of Jehovah. This give me confidence to talk to the white or the black folks, and tell what the Lord had done for my poor soul. After this a great many come to me about religion, some good and some bad folks: for it was generally known that a great change had come over Tom. But I feel so poor, sometimes,  I have to wait      
        CHAPTER III.             My brother Nicholas said, that our brothers recommended to him and myself to run away when we were old enough. We used to talk this over. When God had opened my eyes, I grew very uneasy reflecting upon the condition of my brothers, who were enjoying their liberty in a land of freedom. I wanted also to be free. I resolved to be free. I made up my mind to run away in the year 1837. When I ran away, my brother Nicholas was not at home; but I was determined to go. I was so intimate with a man named Henry, one of my acquaintances, that I told him I was about to run away. He said he would run with me--but he proved a Judas, and betrayed me. We were to start on Monday night. At this time we lived at the village. The pasture in which our horses were           kept was half a mile from the village. Henry told me he would meet me there at half past seven. I tied up all my clothes in a bundle, expecting to start. I waited till after eight o'clock for Henry, but he did not come. I started to go back after him, when, behold! I saw my old master, his two sons, and many other people looking for me. The moon shone very bright--the old man was bare-headed; his head was very white; his spectacles were put back upon his head, and I could see them glisten by the light of the moon. The only reason the old man did not see me was because he was near-sighted, and forgot to pull his spectacles down over his eyes. His two sons were standing in the road where I was to run, and five or six other persons on the watch for me; and my heart was in my mouth. Said I,  Oh! Lord, what shall I do!  I dropped down on my hands and feet, and ran half a mile through the grass. I left my bundle of clothing and           three dollars in money which I had been working for, for some time. All the money I had with me was 75 cents; that a Quaker gentleman gave me that afternoon. I had told this gentleman that I was going to run away that night, and he told me which way to start to get clear. I started for Boston. I travelled all that night. The next morning I came out in a road opposite a tavern, where two roads crossed, and I knew not which to take. I took the east. I was 35 miles from home. The tavern keeper was standing at the door. It was about sunrise. He told me I had the wrong road. I came back to him, supposing I had met with a friend. Said he,  Do you want some breakfast?   Yes, sir, if you please,  I replied.  Come in, and sit down, and you shall have some,  he continued.  No, sir,  said I,  I thank you; I will sit upon the steps.   No,  said the Georgia man,  come in; we will have breakfast pretty soon, and we will all           sit down together.   No, sir, I thank you, I would as soon sit here;  for I thought he was most too kind to be honest; the Quaker man having told me to avoid Georgia men. When he found I would not come in, he took hold of my collar, but I threw him down, for I was resolved to whip the devil out of the way, if possible. After he was down, I ran for my life. There was a colored man bringing a pail of water. He cried out to him to stop me; but I told the colored man if he attempted to trouble me I would knock him down. I jumped over a fence, and the Georgia man after me; but I saw no more of the colored man. The white man struck me in the side with a stone, and run me about a mile. I recovered from the blow of the stone, so that I could run a little faster. God gave me strength  to fight for my life. The white man fought me, and I fought him with any thing that came handy, with fists and with stones. I told him he might kill me or I would           kill him. Finally, I whipped him. There was a Dutchman and his two sons sawing plank in a grist mill. He said,  Glory in your spunk, my man;  and when I had whipped the man he started back after dogs and hounds. Said the Dutchman,  Run for your life, for there are two Georgia men in my house.  I knew them well; they were acquaintances of my master's. Their names were Joshua and Nathan Retlidge, traders.             When I heard the dogs and hounds coming after me, I said,  My God! what shall I do!  for I knew they would put them on my track. I was about to give up, and wished I had never started. However, I climbed up a tree, and in the providence of God, the hounds scared up a rabbit. At the howling of the dogs, I trembled like a leaf, and knew not what to do. The hounds drew nearer and nearer; the rabbit came under the tree where I was, and, through the will of an overruling Providence,           they all passed by, and I was safely delivered out of their hands. It was about eight o'clock in the morning when I climbed the tree. I was hungry and wet with dew. I staid in the tree till about five o'clock in the afternoon. They hunted the woods pretty well, but they did not find me. My words are inadequate to express my joyful feelings at my deliverance. God alone could know my feelings.              I then started for Boston. Then, as now, God alone was my only hope. I travelled a number of days without eating any thing, under great anxiety to see Boston. One morning I met a colored man named George. He was running away, and had got lost. He was from Richmond, Virginia. He asked my name. I told him; and we travelled a number of days together. We called into a shop where we thought no one would harm us, and got something to eat. Thus, under the guidance of Providence, we proceeded along. We came           to a farmer's house, and we let ourselves out each to a farmer for $13 a month, our object being to get money to defray our expenses.             George grew uneasy. He staid only two weeks--was fearful his master would overtake him. He started for New York, but reached only as far as Brunswick, 16 miles from where he started, and, as I heard, was taken up, put in jail and carried back.             I began to grow uneasy. One morning I asked the farmer for whom I worked for $4. He gave me that sum. We went to breakfast. I ate quickly, and cleared. I have not seen him since. I crossed the fields, missed the bridge, and came to a creek, over which I had to swim. I came out into the road. A man in a gig overtook me and inquired who I was, and where I was going. I told him to New Brunswick. He inquired who I knew. I named the individual I had lived with. He went to his house, and I took to the woods, and     
   any unconcerned or disinterested person merry to hear such foolishly frivolous arguments adduced with such solemnity against us. However that I should not be wanting in respect to the whites, nor in justice to my own colour, I shall make such objections to those arguments as will, I pledge myself fully and completely refute them.           As to the first I shall content myself with making one general observation, namely, that God is neither a respecter of persons, nor colours, be they white black, or mulatto, but respects them merely from, their  deedsand  observance of his divine commands, and I humbly but on confidentially insist that not one living can produce a scriptural nor even respectably rational authority in support of such a vague and nonsensical opinion, therefore that argument fails.           As to the second, that we shall not  inhert  the kingdom of God, or enjoy a future state, I wonder where such chimerical notion exists, except in their heated brains or childishly prejudiced imaginations; for scripture tells us expressly,  That all that believe shall be saved,  but to go a step farther, and reason the matter candidly, and without prejudice, I am confident that the odds will be considerably in our favour: And first, I will ask all those persons seriously, how the economy of divine providence with respect to us, can be made  reconcileable  with our conceptions of the nature of the divine Supreme Being and his attributes, upon the supposition of this being the first and final stage of our existence? That we are endowed with reason and reflection, and a sensibility of pain as well as pleasure, is acknowledged to be an incontestible truth, neither can it be denied by any one. Nor is it less evident and unquestionable, that the latter is oftentimes more than overbalanced by the former. To instance only in our poor  brethern  at this moment in slavery, in        the southern states, what exquisite, what affecting tortures do many of them endure (tho' some few of them perhaps meet a more friendly fate) from some merciless callous hearted monster of a master? How frequently to the pangs of hunger, and a distempered body are there added the most cutting stripes and scourges most liberally and as wantonly dealt out to them by their inhuman masters or drivers, and all this merely for their not effecting perhaps impossibilities! But wherefore all this wretchedness, this unrewarded toil and labour? Wherefore all these agonizing pains and miseries heaped on an offspring of divine providence?--And why our colour because happens to be black? Are we not a living animated part of the creation? Are we not flesh and blood? Do we not as well as they know what sorrow means? Yes; and for them only, their use, or accidentally their pride, their wantonness, their cruelty were we brought into a sensible existence! Shall one being be created, but even under the bare possibility of being made miserable more or less) solely for the use and service of another? Lord what is man? Or rather what are not brutes? The unmerited  sufferin  is among whites urged with are great strength of reasoning, in proof of a  recompence  reserved for them hereafter. And must a being that happens to move in a low and humble sphere in society be at once pronounced unworthy of the like provision? But wherefore this partiality to to their noble selves? Why must they plead a right to be dealt with on the part of justice by the Almighty, and yet think it no injury done to us, if our suffering in a state we are forced into by our common Lord and Creator, meet not from him in an hereafter some similar tokens of an universal, and impartial goodness towards his creatures so necessary and essential to the divine nature. But to bring it more closely home to        these our enemies. I will ask them; if they would think it just or equitable for the Moors in Algiers to deny a salvation or a  recompence  in an hereafter to those of this country who are there kept in slavery; and whose colour is white? No, they surely would not, they would laugh at the absurdity of the idea, and treat it with all the ridicule it justly deserved.           That our Saviour did not die for us, and that therefore we cannot hope a redemption through him, is too absurd and ridiculous to merit a moments serious consideration, for our Saviour was the promised hope of the world. And tho' he said he came to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, yet he directed his gospel to be preached to all the Gentiles throughout the world, and we accordingly see that Phillip the Apostle by an express divine command, arose and went to the south and baptized an  Ethiopan,  an Eunuch who was a black man, for which, see the Acts of the Apostles, chap viii. ver. 26, and that in the earliest ages of christianity the gospel was preached to blacks, tawneys, and whites, indiscriminately, is beyond a doubt, for  Abissinia,   Ethiopa,  Epirus, and many other nations of blacks were early converted to christianity, and have continued in the profession of it ever since, and not one disputes their right to saving grace, and in latter years the Portuguese missionaries have converted and admitted the negro inhabitants of their settlements in Africa, into their communion, without making a scruple about their undoubted right as human beings to salvation, nor was it ever questioned until the subtlety of after ages, in order to gloss their diabolical and inhuman traffick, made a pretext of that vague argument to sanction their unprincipled and inhuman conduct. another argument used to prejudice white people against us was, that negroes eat each other, a matter that I utterly deny, and formally call upon them        to produce any one substantial and respectable authority to prove it--they cannot, that negroes sing their war dance around the prisoners taken in battle, I will admit and also that they sacrifice them to their Dhuu, Dhuns, or Gods, but that they ever eat them, themselves, I utterly deny.           As to our being the feed of Cain, it is still more frivolous than the rest, for either their knowledge must be extremely little and contracted, or their memories very weak, else they would have known or remembered that the flood followed after, which drowned all created beings, save what were saved with Noah in his Ark. And  thus, my dear brethren, having shown, I trust, the frivolity and insufficiency of those arguments used against us, and that there must be a salvation for us, I earnestly exhort you to a perfect obedience to the divine will, and to a due performance of the four cardinal virtues, faith, hope, charity, and good works; by a constant practice of which, and due attendance with devout and contrite hearts at some place of divine worship, ye may fervently hope to receive that reward promised to the elect of God through the merits of our Redeemer Christ Jesus, which wish ye all in the name of the Father, Son, and holy Spirit, Amen.           I will next,  y  dear friends, speak to ye on a crime, that alas! too many of you are guilty of, and indeed, it is not confined to our colour alone, but as I do not mean to interfere with the whites who have got able teachers to admonish and reprove them for their faults and transgressions, and as I conceive it to be a duty more particularly incumbent on me to address ye, brethren, I now do so, being actuated by motives of love and zeal for your welfare and interest: it is of lying that I mean to speak to you; a crime which, though truly odious and detestable, is nevertheless, I am sorry to say,     
      Him. I turned to and drank again as usual. In 1853 I was living in the little town of Lamberton, Robertson Co., N.C., near the line of South Carolina, when the greatest revival broke out that I had ever seen, at a Methodist quarterly meeting, during the months of June and July. The people were going up and confessing their religion by scores [.]  God's spirit had been following me until that meeting. I thought at that revival I would seek my soul's salvation. At the revival, Peter Doubt, from Raleigh, preached a sermon. So Martin, of Franklin, preached a sermon. He had formerly been a circuit rider, and was now stationed in Lamberton, they said ruin this revival and the year 1853 will roll some of you into eternity. You may never have another opportunity. Ones' text  Bring my  sipirit  away from Ephriham for he is joined to his idols again.  Ones' text was,  Go your way, Saul,  says Felix,  and come at a more convenient season and I will hear thee,  and during that revival I felt that I was a lost man. I had been so; I felt like this before. But at this revival I could not feel. I attempted to pray, but could'nt pray. I sat then and found out it was all for nothing, it seemed to me the whole of the subject seemed for me. I was the guilty man. The whole of the argument was that God never let His spirit go back to Ephriham again, but left him there and gave him up to be lost and damned forever. Felix never saw Paul again to talk with him, and that was me; both cases seemed to suit me exactly.             On one occasion during the revival I stood up and shed tears like a child; I felt my sins and asked God to forgive me and I would never sin any more--I thought I was a lost man. I went or for weeks, crying and howling to God, going on that I was a lost man. This was in 1853. I attempted to pray and could not. I would up and go, lie down by a place, get up and try it again; no relief for me yet. I would go out during the dark hours of the night, away in a lonesome place to pray. I asked God if he had drawn His spirit away from me and left me to be damned, to show it to me. He manifested that He had not drawn His Holy Spirit from me. You could hear me cry aloud, I was so rejoiced that I could be saved.             In 1854 I professed religion at my work in the woods. I forget the day of the month. In November, 1855, I was baptized ; many sore trials from June 1853 to 1855. They attempted to whip me in 1854 and backed me down but I continued to pray night and day. A  company of men hired me that year--gave Dr. Rogers $300 for me a year. When they did this, I looked at them wistfully, and when they talked of whipping me, I told them to back me down and get their shooting works ready and kill or cripple me and pay for me, for I did not let Dr. Rogers whip me and would not let anyone else do it. I went home to him on or about, the 4th of July, and told him I wanted to leave and must leave. He said that it was a good note, and for me to and stay the year out, as he did not want to take his note in. I answered him and said if he did not want to take his note in I was man enough to take care of myself.             I went back a few days after the 4th of July, but before this time I had professed a hope. I do this to show to men that no devil has the power to keep a man from praying if he is in earnest. In           a few days I left them. I had promised I wouldn't stay with them, and I wouldn't. They did all manner of evil to me except put their hands on me. Day after day, while working there, I was praying to God to convert my soul. They  destroyd  everything of mine they could put their hands on. I never worked another hour after I went back there--they told me they were going to town to hire me out, as I did not want to stay with them. I then went that day past Davis', the overseer, and told him farewell--I was gone.             I concluded to stay out that year until Christmas; this was in July. I staid out for about one mouth, and while out one day, I heard a voice say,  go in, go in, there will be no abuse.  I said, yes, yes, I will go in;  God was protecting me then.            While at the distillery, they destroyed my chickens and pigs, and forbid anyone selling me either chickens or shoats, or anything else; so one day a voice said ,  Christ died for you; can't you give up a few dung-hill chickens for Him?  I said,  Yes, yes; he could give me more or something more.  Bob Jeffries and Jim Litchfield, who were living at Raleigh, N.C., now shot my chickens down. Sim Rodgers, who was an M. C. from Raleigh that year, and Bill Jeffries, of Franklin Co., N.C., were members of the firm.             I walked all that day and nearly all night to get to old Sim Rodgers' place, which I approached about sunrise. On one occasion, while passing the railroad on my way to see my wife and children at Raleigh (I had the luck in 1854 to get a free man in Raleigh to hire my wife and three children, Hillyard Evans by name,) I passed overseer, section hand, railroad hands, white men and colored together.  As I approached them, I cried out to myself, I am a taken man to-day; I am surrounded.  I promised God before I left the woods to give the matter into his hands, as I was in a deep cut. I could not run back nor climb the walls, so I raised my hatchet and said to myself,  If you put your hands on me I will not save one of you.  My feet burned and I never I felt in such a fix in so short a time, when a voice said to me,  I thought you were going to put your trust in God; you are putting it in your hatchet.  I let my hand fall and walked right on. God would not let them touch me; they spoke very politely to me, although they knew a month before that I had run away--the morning I went to see old Sim Rogers. I had to go and see him first man. I bowed a dozen times when within a mile of his house, to God, asking Him to bless me; I had strong faith in God.             I got there and got into conversation with him and got my breakfast, although not hungry--trouble fills any man. He asked me which I would do--go to Raleigh or to Billy Jeffries. I said to Billy Jeffries. When we got ready to start he saddled four horses; one for himself, one for his little son, one for his servant and one for me, and said,  look here, you are not going down there with me; you are going to leave me.  I said,  no, I will go with you.  I had promised God to follow on. He reached back and draws a rope and said he must tie me. I shed tears, as I must either submit to this indignity or fight him back. I could have whipped him out, but I did     
  hooks; then, the letters of the alphabet. These letters  were also in my new spelling-book, and according to  Jacob's directions, I set them before me for a copy, and  wrote on these exercises till I could form all the letters  and call them by name. One evening I wrote out my  name in large letters --  THOMAS JONES.  This I  carried to Jacob, in a great excitement of happiness,  and he warmly commended me for my perseverance and  diligence.          About this time, I was at the store early one morning,  and, thinking I was safe from all danger for a few  minutes, had seated myself in the back store, on one of  the barrels, to study in my precious spelling-book.  While I was absorbed in this happy enterprise, my master  came in, much earlier than usual, and I did not hear him. He came directly into the back store. I saw his  shadow on the wall, just in time to throw my book over  in among the barrels, before he could see what it was,  although he saw that I had thrown something quickly  away. His suspicion was aroused. He said that I had  been stealing something out of the store, and fiercely  ordered me to get what I threw away just as he was  coming in at the door. Without a moment's hesitation,  I determined to save my precious book and my future  opportunities to learn out of it. I knew if my book  was discovered that all was lost, and I felt prepared for  any hazard or suffering rather than give up my book  and my hopes of improvement. So I replied at once  to his questions, that I had not thrown anything away;  that I had not stolen anything from the store; that I  did not have anything in my hands which I could throw  away when he came in. My master declared in a high  passion, that I was lying, and ordered me to begin and  roll away the barrels. This I did; but managed to  keep the book slipping along so that he could not see  it, as he stood in the door-way. He charged me again  with stealing and throwing something away, and I  again denied the charge. In a great rage, he got down  his long, heavy cow-hide, and ordered me to strip off        my jacket and shirt, saying, with an oath,  I will make  you tell me what it was you had when I came.  I  stripped myself, and came forward, according to his directions,  at the same time denying his charge with great  earnestness of tone, and look, and manner. He cut me  on my naked back, perhaps thirty times, with great severity,  making the blood flow freely. He then stopped,  and asked me what I had thrown away as he came in.  I answered again that I had thrown nothing away. He  swore terribly; said he was certain I was lying, and  declared he would kill me if I did not tell him the truth.  He whipped me the second time with greater severity,  and at greater length than before. He then repeated  his question, and I answered again as before. I was  determined to die, if I could possibly bear the pain,  rather than give up my dear book. He whipped me  the third time, with the same result as before, and then  seizing hold of my shoulders, turned me round as  though he would inflict on my quivering flesh still another  scourging, but he saw the deep gashes he had already  made, and the blood already flowing under his  cruel infliction; and his stern purpose failed him. He  said,  Why, Tom, I didn't think I had cut you so bad,  and saying that, he stopped, and told me to put on my  shirt again. I did as he bade me, although my coarse  shirt touching my raw back put me to a cruel pain.  He then went out, and I got my book and hid it safely  away before he came in again. When I went to the  house, my wounds had dried, and I was in an agony of  pain. My mistress told the servant girl, Rachel, to help  me off with my shirt, and to wash my wounds for me,  and put on to them some sweet oil. The shirt was dried  to my back so that it could not be got off without tearing  off some of the skin with it. The pain, upon doing  this, was greater even than I had endured from my  cruel whipping. After Rachel had got my shirt off,  my mistress asked me what I had done for which my  master had whipped me so severely. I told her he had  accused me of stealing when I had not, and then had whipped me to make me own it.                 While Rachel was putting on the sweet oil my master  came in, and I could hear mistress scolding him for  giving me such an inhuman beating, when I had done  nothing. He said in reply, that Tom was an obstinate  liar, and that was the reason why he had whipped me.          But I got well of my mangled back, and my book  was still left. This was my best, my constant friend.  With great eagerness, I snatched every moment I  could get, morning, noon and night, for study. I had  begun to read; and, oh, how I loved to study, and to  dwell on the thoughts which I gained from reading.  About this time, I read a piece in my book about God.  It said that  God, who sees and knows all our thoughts,  loves the good and makes them happy; while he is  angry with the bad, and will punish them for all their  sins.  This made me feel very unhappy, because I was  sure I was not good in the sight of God. I thought  about this, and could'nt get it out of my mind a single  hour. So I went to James Galley, a colored man, who  exhorted the slaves sometimes on Sunday, and told him  my trouble, asking,  what shall I do?  He told me  about Jesus, and told me I must pray the Lord to forgive  me and help me to be good and happy. So I  went home, and went down cellar and prayed, but I  found no relief, no comfort for my unhappy mind. I  felt so bad that I could not study my book. My master  saw that I looked very unhappy, and he asked me  what ailed me. I did not dare  now  to tell a lie, for I  wanted to be good, that I might be happy. So I told  my master just how it was with me; and then he swore  terribly at me, and said he would whip me if I did not  give over praying. He said there was no heaven and  no hell, and that Christians were all hypocrites, and  that there was nothing after this life, and that he would  not permit me to go moping round, praying and going  to the meetings. I told him I could not help praying,  and then he cursed me in a great passion, and declared  he would whip me if he knew of my going on any more  in that foolish way. The next night I was to a meeting,           which was led by Jack Cammon,a free colored  man, and a class leader in the Methodist Church. I  was so much overcome by my feelings, that I staid very  late. They prayed for me, but I did not yet find any  relief; I was still very unhappy. The next morning,  my master came in, and asked me if I went the night  before to the meeting. I told him the truth. He  said, didn't I tell you I would whip you if you went  nigh these meetings, and did n't I tell you to stop this  foolish praying?  I told him he did, and if he would,  why, he might whip me, but still I could not stop praying,  because I wanted to be good, that I might be happy  and go to heaven. This reply made my master  very angry. With many bitter oaths, he said he had  promised me a whipping, and now he should be as good  as his word. And so he was. He whipped me, and  then forbade, with bitter threatenings, my praying any  more, and especially my going again to meeting. This  was Friday morning. I continued to pray for comfort  and peace. The next Sunday I went to meeting. The  minister preached a sermon on being born again, from  the words of Jesus to Nicodemus. All this alone  deepened my trouble of mind. I returned home very  unhappy. Collins, a free man of color, was at the  meeting, and told my master that I was there. So, on  Monday morning my master whipped me again, and  once more forbade my going to meetings and praying.  The next Sunday there was a class meeting, led by  Binney Pennison, a colored free man. I asked my  master, towards night, if I might go out. I told him I  did not feel well. I wanted to go to the class meeting.  Without asking me  where  I was going, he said I might  go. I went to the class. I staid very late, and I was  so overcome by my feelings, that I could not go home  that night. So they carried me to Joseph Jones' cabin,  a slave of Mr. Jones. Joseph talked and prayed with  me nearly all night. In the morning I went home as  soon as it was light, and, for fear of master, I asked  Nancy, one of the slaves, to go into mistress's room       and get the store key for me, that I might go and open  the store. My master told her to go back and tell me  to come up. I obeyed with many fears. My master  asked me where I had been the night before. I told  him the whole truth. He cursed me again, and said he  should whip me for my obstinate disobedience; and he  declared he would kill me if I did not promise to obey  him. He refused to listen to my mistress, who was a  professor, and who tried to intercede for me. And,  just as soon as he had finished threatening me with  what he would do, he ordered me to take the key and  go and open the store. When he came into the store  that morning, two of his neighbors, Julius Dumbiven, and McCauslin, came in too. He called me up and asked  me again where I staid last night. I told him with  his boy, Joseph. He said he knew that was a lie; and  he immediately sent off for Joseph to confirm his suspicions.  He ordered me to strip off my clothes, and,  as I did so, he took down the cow-hide, heavy and stiff  with blood which he had before drawn from my body  with that cruel weapon, and which was congealed upon  it. Dumbiven professed to be a Christian, and he now  came forward, and earnestly interceded for me, but to  no purpose, and then he left. McCauslin asked my  master, if he did not know that a slave was worth  more money after he became pious than he was before.  And why then, he said, should you forbid Tom going  to meetings and praying? He replied, that religion  was all a damned mockery, and he was not going to  have any of his slaves praying and whining round  about their souls. McCauslin then left. Joseph came  and told the same story about the night before that I  had done; and then he began to beg master not to  whip me. He cursed him and drove him off. He then  whipped me with great severity, inflicting terrible pain  at every blow upon my quivering body, which was still  very tender from recent lacerations. My suffering was  so great, that it seemed to me I should die. He paused  at length, and asked me would I mind him and stop       praying. I told him I could not promise him not to  pray any more, for I felt that I must and should pray  as long as I lived.  Well, then, Tom,  he said,  I  swear that I will whip you to death.  I told him I  could not help myself, if he was determined to kill me,  but that  I must pray while I lived.  He then began to  whip me the second time, but soon stopped, threw down  the bloody cowhide, and told me to go wash myself in  the river, just back of the store, and then dress myself,  and if I was determined to be a fool, why, I must be  one. My mistress now interceded earnestly for me  with my cruel master. The next Sabbath was love  feast, and I felt very anxious to join in that feast. This  I could not do without a paper from my master, and so  I asked mistress to help me. She advised me to be  patient, and said she would help me all she could.  Master refused to give any paper, and so I could not  join in the love feast the next day.          On the next Friday evening, I went to the prayer  meeting. Jack Cammon was there, and opened the  meeting with prayer. Then Binney Pennison gave  out the sweet hymn, which begins in these words:    Come ye sinners, poor and needy,  Weak and wounded, sick and sore.             I felt that it all  applied most sweetly to my condition,  and I said in my heart,  I  will come  now  to Jesus, and   trust  in him. So when those who felt anxious were  requested to come forward and kneel within the altar  for prayer,  I  came and knelt down. While Jacob  Cammon was praying for me, and for those who knelt  by my side, my burden of sorrow, which had so long  weighed me down, was removed. I felt the glory of  God's love warming my heart, and making me very  happy. I shouted aloud for joy, and tried to tell all  my poor slave brothers and sisters, who were in the  house, what a dear Saviour I had found, and how happy  I felt in his precious love. Binney Pennison asked me  if I could forgive my master. I told him I could, and           did, and that I could pray God to forgive him, too, and  make him a good man. He asked me if I could tell  my master of the change in my feelings. I told him I  should  tell him in the morning.  And what,  he said    will you do if he whips you still for praying and  going to meeting?  I said I will ask Jesus to help  me to bear the pain, and to forgive my master for being  so wicked. He then said,  Well, then, Brother  Jones, I believe that you are a Christian.           A good many of us went from the meeting to a  brother's cabin, where we began to express our joy in  happy songs. The palace of General Dudley was only  a little way off, and he soon sent over a slave with  orders to stop our noise, or he would send the patrolers  upon us. We then stopped our singing and spent the  remainder of the night in talking, rejoicing and praying.  It was a night of very great happiness to me.  The contrast between my feelings then, and for many  weeks previous, was very great. Now, all was bright  and joyous in my relations towards my precious Saviour.  I felt certain that Jesus was my Saviour, and in this  blessed assurance a flood of glory and joy filled my  happy soul. But this sweet night passed away, and,  as the morning came, I felt that I must go home, and  bear the  slave's heavy  cross. I went, and told my mistress  the blessed change in my feelings. She promised  me what aid she could give me with my master, and  enjoined upon me to be patient and very faithful to his  interest, and, in this way, I should at length wear out  his opposition to my praying and going to meeting.          I went down to the store in a very happy state of  mind. I told James my feelings. He called me a  fool, and said master would be sure to whip me. I  told him I hoped I should be able to bear it, and to forgive  master for his cruelty to me. Master came down,  talked with me a while, and told me he should whip me  because I had disobeyed him in staying out all night.  He had told me he should whip me if ever I did so, and  he should make every promise good. So I began to  take off my clothes. He called me a crazy fool, and         told me to keep my clothes on till he told me take them  off. He whipped me over my jacket; but I enjoyed so  much peace of mind that I scarcely felt the cow-hide.  This was the last whipping that Mr. Jones inflicted  upon me.          I was then nearly eighteen years old. I waited and  begged for a paper to join the church six months before  I could get it. But all this time I was cheerful, as far  as a slave can be, and very earnest to do all I could do  for my master and mistress. I was resolved to convince  them that I was happier and better for being a Christian;  and my master at last acknowledged that he could  not find any fault with my conduct, and that it was impossible  to find a more faithful slave than I was to him.  And so, at last, he gave me a paper to Ben English,the  leader of the colored members, and I joined the love  feast, and was taken into the church on trial for six  months. I was put into Billy Cochrane's class. At  the expiration of six months, I was received into the  Church in full fellowship, Quaker Davis'class. I remained  there three years. My master was much kinder  after this time than he had ever been before; and I was  allowed some more time to myself than I had been before.  I pursued my studies as far as I could, but I soon  found the utter impossibility of carrying on my studies  as I wished to do. I was a slave, and all avenues to  real improvement I found guarded with jealous care and  cruel tenacity against the despised and desolated bondman.          I still felt a longing desire to improve, to be free, but  the conviction was getting hold of my soul that I was  only struggling in vain when seeking to elevate myself  into a manly and happy position. And now my mind  was fast sinking into despair. I could read and write,  and often enjoyed much happiness in poring over the  very few books I could obtain; and especially, at times,  I found great peace in reading my old worn Testament.  But I wanted now that hope which had filled my mind  with such joy when I first began to learn to read. I  found much happiness in prayer. But here, also, my       
      I had then got along so that I was reading and spelling in words of two syllables.             After I was deprived of my kind little teacher, I plodded on the best way I could by myself, and in this way I got into words of five syllables. I got some little time to study by daylight in the morning, before any of my master's family had risen. I got a moment's opportunity also at noon, and sometimes at night. During the day I was in the back store a good deal, and whenever I thought I could have a few minutes to myself, I would take my book and try to learn a little in reading and spelling. If I heard James, or master Jones, or any customer coming in, I would drop my book among the barrels, and pretended to be very busy  shovelling  the salt or doing some other work. Several times I came very near being detected. My master suspected something, because I was so still in the back room, and a number of times he came very slyly to see what I was about. But at such times I was always so fortunate as to hear his tread or to see his shadow on the wall in time to hide away my book.             When I had got along to words of five syllables, I went to see a free colored friend, Ned Cowen, whom I knew I could trust, and told him that I was trying to learn to read, and asked him to help me a little. He told me I had got along far enough to get another book, in which I could learn to write the letters, as well as to read. He told me where and how to procure this book. I followed his directions, and obtained another spelling book at Worcester's store in Wilmington. Jacob showed me a little about writing. He set me a copy, first of straight marks. I now got me a box, which I could hide under my bed, some ink, pens, and a bit of candle. So, when I went to bed, I pulled my box out from under my cot, turned it up on end, and began my first attempt at writing. I worked away till my candle was burned out, and then lay down to sleep. Jacob next set me a copy, which he called pot-hooks; then, the letters of the alphabet. These letters were also in my new spelling-book, and according to Jacob's directions, I set them before me for a copy, and wrote on these exercises till I could form all the letters and call them by name. One evening, I wrote out my name in large letters, -- THOMAS JONES. This I carried to Jacob, in a great excitement of happiness, and he warmly commended me for my perseverance and  dilligence .             About this time, I was at the store early one morning, and thinking I was safe from all danger for a few minutes, had seated myself in the back store, on one of the barrels, to study in my precious spelling-book.  While I was absorbed in this happy           enterprise, my master came in, much earlier than usual, and I did not hear him. He came directly into the back store. I saw his shadow on the wall, just in time to throw my book over in among the barrels, before he could see what it was, although he saw that I had thrown something quickly away. His suspicion was aroused. He said that I had been stealing something out of the store, and he fiercely ordered me to get what I threw away just as he was coming in at the door. Without a moment's hesitation, I determined to save my precious book and my future opportunities to learn out of it. I knew if my book was discovered, that all was lost, and I felt prepared for any hazard or suffering rather than give up my book and my hopes of improvement. So I replied at once to his question, that I had not thrown anything away; that I had not stolen anything from the store; that I did not have anything in my hands which I could throw away when he came in. My master declared, in high passion, that I was lying, and ordered me to begin and roll away the barrels. This I did; but managed to keep the book slipping along so that he could not see it, as he stood in the door-way. He charged me again with stealing and throwing something away, and I again denied the charge. In a great rage, he then got down his long, heavy cow-hide, and ordered me to strip off my jacket and shirt, saying, with an oath,  I will make you tell me what it was you had when I came in.  I stripped myself, and came forward, according to his directions, the same time denying his charge with great earnestness of tone, and look, and manner. He cut me on my naked back, perhaps thirty times, with great severity, making the blood flow freely. He then stopped, and asked me what I had thrown away as he came in. I answered again that I had thrown nothing away. He swore terribly; said he was certain I was lying,  and declared that he would kill me, if I did not tell him the truth. He whipped me the second time with greater severity, and at greater length than before. He then repeated his question,  and I answered again as before. I was determined to die, if I could possibly bear the pain, rather than give up my dear book. He whipped me the third time, with the same result as before, and then, seizing hold of my shoulders, turned me round, as though he would inflict on my quivering flesh still another scourging; but he saw the deep gashes he had already made, and the blood already flowing under his cruel infliction; and his stern purpose failed him. He said,   Why, Tom, I  din't  think I had cut you so bad,  and, saying that, he stopped, and told me to put on my shirt again. I did as he bade me, although my coarse shirt touching my raw back put me to a cruel pain. He           then went out, and I got my book and hid it safely away before he came in again. When I went to the house, my wounds had dried and I was in an agony of pain. My mistress told the servant girl, Rachel, to help me off with my shirt, and to wash my wounds for me, and to put on to them some sweet oil. The shirt was dried to my back, so that it could not be got off without tearing off some of the skin with it. The pain, upon doing this, was greater even than I had endured from my cruel whipping. After Rachel had got my shirt off, my mistress asked me what I had done for which my master had whipped me so severely. I told her he had accused me of stealing when I had not, and then had whipped me to make me own it.             While Rachel was putting on the sweet oil, my master came in, and I could hear mistress scolding him for giving me such an inhuman beating, when I had done nothing. He said in reply, that Tom was an obstinate liar, and that was the reason why he had whipped me.             But I got well of my mangled back, and my book was as still left. This was my best, my constant friend. With great eagerness,  I snatched every moment I could get, morning, noon, and night, for study. I had begun to read; and, Oh, how I loved to study, and to dwell on the thoughts which I gained from my reading. About this time, I read a piece in my book about God. It said that  God, who sees and knows all our thoughts, loves the good and makes them happy; while he is angry with the bad, and will punish them for all their sins.  This made me feel very  unhapdy , because I was sure that I was not good in the sight of God. I thought about this, and couldn't get it out of my mind a single hour. So I went to James Galley, a colored man, who exhorted the slaves sometimes on Sunday, and told him my trouble, asking,  what shall I do?  He told me about Jesus, and told me I must pray the Lord to forgive me and help me to be good and happy. So I went home, and went down cellar and prayed, but I found no relief, no comfort for my unhappy mind. I felt so bad, that I could not even study my book. My master saw that I looked very unhappy, and he asked me what ailed me. I did not dare now to tell a lie, for I wanted to be good, that I might be happy. So I told master  just how it was with me; and then he swore terribly at me, and said he would whip me if I did not give over praying. He said there was no heaven and no hell, and that Christians were all hypocrites, and that there was nothing, after this life, and that he would not permit me to go moping round, praying and going to the meetings. I told him I could not help praying; and then he cursed me in a great passion, and declared that he would           whip me if he knew of my going on any more in that foolish way.  The next night I was to a meeting, which was led by Jack Cammon, a free colored man, and a class leader in the Methodist Church. I was so much overcome by my feelings, that I  staid  very late. They prayed for me, but I did not yet find any relief; I was still very unhappy. The next morning, my master came in, and asked me if I went the night before to the meeting. I told him the truth. He said,   didn't I tell you I would whip you if you went nigh these meetings, and didn't I tell you to stop this foolish praying.  I told him he did, and if he would, why, he might whip me, but still I could not stop praying, because I wanted to be good, that I might be happy and go to heaven. This reply made my master very angry. With many bitter oaths, he said he had promised me a whipping, and now he should be as good as his word. And so he was. He whipped me, and then forbade, with bitter threatenings, my praying any more, and especially my going again to meeting. This was Friday morning. I continued to pray for comfort and peace. The next Sunday I went to meeting. The minister preached a sermon on being born again, from the words of Jesus  to Nicodemus. All this only deepened my trouble of mind. I returned home very unhappy. Collins, a free man of color, was at the meeting, and told my master that I was there. So, on Monday morning my master whipped me again, and once more forbade my going to meetings and praying. The next Sunday there was a class meeting, led by Binney Pennison, a colored free man. I asked my master, towards night, if I might go out. I told him I did not feel well. I wanted to go to the class meeting. Without asking me where I was going, he said I might go. I went to the class. I  staid  very late, and was so overcome by my feelings, that I could not go home that night. So they carried me to Joseph Jones's cabin, a slave of Mr. Jones. Joseph talked and, prayed with me nearly all night. In the morning I went home as soon as it was light, and, for fear of master, I asked Nancy, one of the slaves, to go up into mistress's  room and get the store key for me, that I might go and open the store. My master told her to go back and tell me to come up. I obeyed with many fears. My master asked me where I had been the night before. I told him the whole truth. He cursed me again, and said he should whip me for my obstinate disobedience; and he declared that he would kill me if I did not promise to obey him. He refused to listen to my mistress who was a professor, and who tried to intercede for me. And, just as soon as he had finished threatening me with what he would do, he ordered me to take the key and go and open           the store. When he came into the store that morning, two of his neighbors, Julius Dumbiven, and MacCauslin, came in too. He called me up, and asked me again where I  staid  last night. I told him with his boy, Joseph. He said he knew that was a lie; and he immediately sent off for Joseph to confirm his suspicions. He ordered me to strip off my clothes, and, as I did so, he took down the cow hide heavy and stiff with blood which he had before drawn from my body with that cruel weapon, and which was congealed upon it. Dumbiven professed to be a Christian, and he now came forward and earnestly interceded for me, but to no purpose, and then he left. McCauslin asked my master, if he did not know, that a slave was worth more money after he became pious than he was before. And why then, he said, should you forbid Tom going to meetings and praying? He replied, that religion was all a damned mockery, and he was not going to have any of his slaves praying and whining round about their souls. McCauslin then left. Joseph came and told the same story about the night before that I had done, and then began to beg master not to whip me. He cursed him and drove him off. He then whipped me with great severity, inflicting terrible pain at every blow upon my quivering body which was still very tender from recent lacerations. My suffering was so great, that it seemed to me that I should die. He paused at length, and asked me would I mind him and stop praying. I told him I could not promise him not to pray any more, for I felt that I must and should pray as long as I lived.  Well, then, Tom,  he said,  I swear that I will whip you to death.  I told him I could not help myself, if he was determined to kill me, but that I must pray while I lived. He then began to whip me the second time, but soon stopped, threw down the bloody cow-hide, and told me to go wash myself in the river, just back of the store, and then dress myself, and if I was determined to be a fool, why I must be one. My mistress now interceded earnestly for me with my cruel master. The next Sabbath was love feast, and I felt very anxious to join in that feast. This I could not do without a paper from my master, and so I asked mistress to help me. She advised me to be patient, and said she would help me all she could. Master refused to give any paper, and so I could not join the loving feast the next day.             On the next Friday evening, I went to the prayer meeting. Jack Cammon was there, and opened the meeting with prayer. Then Binney Pennison gave out the sweet hymn, which begins in these words:      Come ye sinners poor and needy,               I felt that it all applied most sweetly to my condition, and I said in my heart, I will come now to Jesus, and trust in him. So when those who felt anxious were requested to come forward and kneel within the altar for prayer, I came and knelt down. While Jacob Cammon was praying for me, and for those who knelt by my side, my burden of sorrow, which had so long weighed me down, was removed. I felt the glory of God's love warming my heart, and making me very happy, I shouted aloud for joy, and tried to tell all my poor slave brothers and sisters, who were in the house, what a dear Saviour I had found, and how happy I felt in his precious love. Binney Pennison asked me if I could forgive my master. I told him I could, and did, and that I could pray God to forgive him, too, and make him a good man. He asked me if I could tell my master of the change in my feelings. I told him I should tell him in the morning.  And what,  he asked,  will you do if he whips you still for praying and going to meeting ?  I said I will ask Jesus to help me bear the pain, and to forgive my master for being so wicked. He then said,   Well, then, Brother Jones, I believe that you are a Christian.              A good many of us went from the meeting to a brother's cabin, where we began to express our joy in happy songs. The palace of General Dudley was only a little way off, and he soon sent over a slave with orders to stop our noise, or he would send the patrolers upon us. We then stopped our singing, and spent the remainder of the night in talking, rejoicing, and praying. It was a night of very great happiness to me. The contrast between my feelings then, and for many weeks previous, was very great. Now all was bright and joyous in my relations towards my precious Saviour. I felt certain that Jesus was my Saviour, and in this blessed assurance, a flood of glory and joy filled my happy soul. But this sweet night passed away, and, as the morning came, I felt that I must go home, and bear the slave's heavy cross. I went and told my mistress the blessed change in my feelings. She promised me what aid she could give with my master, and enjoined upon me to be patient and very faithful to his interest, and, in this way, I should at length wear out his  opposiition  to my praying and going to meeting.             I went down to the store in a very happy state of mind. I told James my feelings.  He called me a fool, and said master would be sure to whip me. I told him I hoped I should be able to bear it, and to forgive master for his cruelty to me. Master came down, talked with me a while, and told me that he should whip me because I had disobeyed him in staying out all night. He had told me he should whip me if ever I did so, and he           should make every promise good. So I began to take off my clothes. He called me a crazy fool, and told me to keep my clothes on, till he told me to take them off. He whipped me over my jacket; but I enjoyed so much peace of mind, that I scarcely felt the cow-hide. This was the last whipping that Mr. Jones inflicted upon me.             I was then nearly eighteen years old. I waited and begged for a paper to join the Church six months before I could get it. But all this time I was cheerful, as far as a slave can be, and very earnest to do all I could for my master and mistress. I was resolved to convince them that I was happier and better for being a Christian, and my master at last acknowledged that he could not find any fault with my conduct, and that it was impossible to find a more faithful slave than I was to him. And so, at last he gave a paper to Ben English, the leader of the colored members, and I joined the love feast, and was taken into the Church on trial for six months. I was put into Billy Cochran's class. At the expiration of six months, I was received into the Church in full fellowship, Quaker Davis' class. I remained there three years. My master was much kinder after this time than he had formerly been, and I was allowed some more time to myself than I had been before. I pursued my studies as far as I could, but I soon found the utter impossibility of carrying on my studies as I wished to do. I was a slave, and all avenues to real improvement I found guarded with jealous care and cruel tenacity against the despised and desolate bondman.             I still felt a longing desire to improve, to be free, but the conviction  was getting hold of my soul, that I was only struggling in vain, when seeking to elevate myself into a manly and happy position. And now my mind was fast sinking into despair. I could read and write, and often enjoyed much happiness in poring over the very few books I could obtain; and especially, at times, I found great peace in reading my old, worn Testament. But I wanted now that hope which had filled my mind with such joy when I first began to learn to read. I found much happiness in prayer. But here, also, my mind labored in sadness and darkness much of the time.             About this time, my master was taken sick. On Sunday, he was prostrated by mortal pains and on Friday the same week, he died. He left fifteen slaves. I was purchased by Owen Holmes for $435 , 00. I was then in my twenty-third year. I had just passed through the darkest season of despairing agony that I had yet known. This came upon me in consequence of the visit, which I have already described, to my dear old desolate home. About this time, too, I entered into a new and distinct     
      minister at night, and taking him off from his horse and beat him until they thought he was dead. But the Lord saved his life to preach his Word, and many were converted in the same town through his preaching, and many masters, when converted, set their slaves free.             My grandmother died at ninety years of age; my mother at seventy, and my father at eighty years of age. These three friends died in the strongest triumph of faith in Jesus, who when on earth said he would be with his people to the end of the world. Amen.             Perhaps some person will ask why did I teach the art of wrestling, boxing and fighting, when desirous to learn to read the Bible? I answer because no one is so contemptible as a coward. With us a coward is looked upon as the most degraded wretch on earth, and is only worthy to be a slave. My brother's master, Governor R. Right, of Maryland, taught his children never to take an insult from one of           their equals--that is, from the rich and educated. Their domestic slaves were taught not to take an insult from another rich man's domestic slave under any consideration. By this, you perceive, I was trying to be respectable by doing like the rich. Those who read the lives of our great statesmen, know they were duellists. Then I thought he who could control his antagonist by the art of his physical power was a greater man. But I thank the Lord, since the 21st of Feb., 1836, I have been enabled to see things in a different light, and believe the man is greater who can overcome his foes by his Christlike example.             A word to my colored friends. It is often said that we are a degraded people in this country as well as in Africa. Before we consent to the charge, let us look at the word degradation. Walker says it means  deprivation of office or dignity, degeneracy, to lessen, to diminish.  I cannot see that his explanation           has anything to do with the charge against us in a moral sense of the term. When properly taken into consideration, if we only number one-sixth part of the population of the United States. Because we have six men against one to vote us out of office; that is not degrading us, it is oppressing us. If six colored men should take a white child from its parents, and teach it that its highest obligations belong to us, we six men, that we stand in the place of God--this is the kind of education many of our people have at the south. Now I ask if this child should become a sabbath-breaker, or a liar, a thief, or a drunkard, or an adulterer, not having the advantage to know better, I ask who is the degraded man? Paul says, Romans 4; 15: For where there is no law there is no transgression. Then the moral guilt rests on the oppressor and not on the oppressed. We must not feel that we are degraded. The true meaning of the word           degrade, is to be low, mean, contemptible, willing to do a mean act that we know is displeasing in the sight of God and man. Therefore we may be oppressed by man, but never morally degraded, only as we are made willing subjects to do sinful acts against what we know or have the power to know is wrong in the sight of God and man.             No difference how poor we are, if we are respectable, honest, and upright, with God, ourselves, and our fellow man. For St. Peter declares, Acts 10, 34-35, that God is no respecter of persons. But in every nation, he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him. And if any man is accepted with his God, then oppression, nor prejudice, or prisons, or chains, or whips, or anything formed by man, cannot degrade us. No, we must voluntarily subscribe to some mean act before we can be mean or low in the sight of our dear Lord and Master.      
     of which, as he fancied, I often got severe floggings from him. Still, I did not wish my situation changed, for I considered my station a very high one; preferring an occasional licking, to being thrown out of office.             Being a gentleman's body servant, I had nothing more to do with plantation affairs, and, consequently, thought myself much superior to those children who had to sweep the yard. I was about twelve years old when given to John Wagar.      CHAP. IV.             FIDDLING and dancing being done away with among the slaves, by the disappearance of Martin's fiddle, Christianity seemed to gain ground, and a glorious revival of religion sprang up, which required another legal provision to suppress. This was the new provision: that the patrolers should search the slave quarters, on every plantation, from whence, if they found any slaves absent after night fall, they should receive, when found, thirty-nine lashes upon the naked back. When the slaves were caught, if a constable were present, he could administer the punishment immediately. If no constable were present, then the truant slave must be taken before a justice of the peace, where he must receive not less than five, nor more than thirty-nine lashes, unless he could show a pass, either from his master or his overseer. Many were           thus whipped, both going to and returning from night meetings; or, worse still, often taken from their knees while at prayer, and cruelly whipped.             But this did not stop the progress of God's mighty work, for he had laid the foundation for the building, and his workmen determined to carry on the work until the capstone was laid.             Many slaves were sold farther south, for going to meetings. They would sometimes travel four or five miles, attend meeting and return in time for the overseer's horn.            Mr. Wagar had a valuable slave named Aaron, a carpenter by trade, and an excellent workman; a man of true piety and great physical strength. He never submitted to be flogged, unless compelled by superior force; and although he was often whipped, still it did not conquer his will, nor lessen his bravery; so that, whenever his master attempted to whip him, it was never without the assistance of, at least, five or six men. Such men there were who were always ready to lend their aid in such emergencies. Aaron was too valuable to shoot, and his master did not wish to sell him; but at last, growing tired of calling on help to whip a slave, and knowing that neglecting to do this would appear like a submission to the negro, which in time might prove dangerous, since other slaves, becoming unruly, might resist him, until he could not flog any of them without help. He finally concluded to sell Aaron, much as he disliked it.             The slave was at work at the time, sawing heavy timber, to build a barn. The manner of sawing such timber, at the South, is by what they call a whip saw. A     
      you, how Ann street runs, tell him, it runs parallel with Commercial street; saying this, turn away with a laugh from the captain, telling him he needs no information about the streets of Boston, as he knows as well as you do of these situations. These questions he made me answer to him many times; and fortunate for me that he did, for I found them of great value to me. He then left me, charging me to go on board precisely at twelve o'clock, if I did not see him before that time. I spent all the rest of the morning in repeating my simple, but important catechism,--quite as much so to me in my situation as ever the famous Shorter Catechism, of Westminster Assembly notoriety, was to a youngster just receiving his first theological lesson from the lips of a Presbyterian parent, anxious to save the soul of his child; well will it be for all who repeat that important religious catechism, if it renders them as effectual service, in saving their souls, as mine did in saving my body and soul from slavery's cursed hell,--and thinking of the hour, waiting with impatience its approach, and yet dreading its coming; for I had seen so many slaves brought back, and witnessed the dreadful punishment they have received for attempting to get their freedom, that I shuddered at the consequence of detection. The hour at last arrived. My friends had not returned, and I started for the ship; but, as I came in sight of it, my courage forsook me. I feared that I should not be able to appear manly and fearless. Had I not been bought under the lash of the white man? had not everything of a manly nature been beaten out of me? had I not been taught that I was a slave,--that I was ever to remain a slave? that it was the wish of Almighty God that I should be content     
0      and the reason many were deceived was because they was not honest to themselves.            I think God has begun a good work in this part of his heritage, in which he has and continues to sow the seed of his kingdom; and while I am aware there is much that falls on the stony ground, I feel encouraged in the belief that there has some fallen on good ground, and I often pray God to prosper it, that it may bring forth fruit to his praise, and that the stony heart of man may be subdued. The Lord has lately been showing a small field of labor, which I believe it is his will that I should enter into, although the time it is to be accomplished, and the manner in which it is to be brought about, is yet hid from me; although, not long since, there came a delegation from the very place, inviting me to go and see them on a gospel mission. I told them that a mere call from man was not sufficient to set off on such a work; and I also told them that if the Lord had put it in their hearts to call me to their neighborhood, he would probably renew it, when one of them, a very humble-hearted Christian, said that he felt before leaving  home that it was the will of God. I then informed  them how I had felt about it, and I further told them that forty odd years had now passed away since the Lord first call me to this work; and when I excuse myself, saying,  I, poor slave,  and so on, he promise he help whenever I need him, and his promises are yea and amen forever; and at that time I did not know A from B, and I know but very little now, except what the Lord teach me, neither do I desire to, for God has said he will teach his people hisself, so that if a man lack wisdom he should ask it of God, and not of man, whose breath is in his nostrils,            very humble people at that time,) when I was awakened to a sense of my condition from these words, dropped from a humble minister:  The wicked have no hope beyond the grave, while the righteous have a hope beyond Jordan's cold stream; and after they have crossed Jordan they have gone home to a God of pity, to a God of compassion, to a God of sovereign mercy.  These words took a deep hold on my wicked heart, and break up the great deep in my soul. And this prepare me to seek such a friend. And after searching a long season of time, the Friend of Sinners appear and fill my heart with love. He give me peace of soul and confidence of mind; then I could gladly tell this glorious Savior's mine. This  destroyed all earthly fear, and prepare me to rest in hope. And  then I could say, by sea or land, by day or night:  The Lord is ever mine!  Forty odd years I travel on in this way, and it now appears more precious than the first. And now I say:                 Now, I would be glad for all the world to know that after I was awakened, as I have described, that love, in place of fear, fill my heart. May be I better say here that very often, when I goin' on in wickedness, something tell me this wicked, and I feel very bad. At that time I did not know that it was that good Spirit talking with me; yet I know all the time that I was doing wrong, 'cause I feel guilty, and that make me afraid. But when I give all up to serve the Lord, He promise He help whenever I need Him. And soon     
       Sukey Bat Moore on the Art of Flying.             One summer night about twelve o'clock my mother was awakened by Sukey (who had just  returned from a  revival ) kneeling at her bedside, saying,  Mistis, Mistis, pray for me,--Judy Freeman has got religion and I can't git it.  My mother tried to soothe, and promised to pray for  her. Later on she gave evidence of having  come through.  Not long afterward while in church she felt happy, and began to shout, saying,  Oh! I feel I can fly to heaven!  Some of the sisters said to her,  Aunt Sukey, do try,  and under the influence of excitement she really did jump out of the window, and of course fell to the ground; fortunately it was very low and she sustained no injury. One of her friends asked her why she failed to fly. She replied,  I dunno, honey, 'cept as how I didn't git de  right flop  !     NOTE--Alluding to the habit of fowls raising and  lowering their wings in order to inflate their lungs before  flying, which is usually termed flopping.            Return to Menu 
      often tried to conceal it. Capt. Auld was not a born slaveholder-- not a birthright member of the slave-holding oligarchy.  He was only a slaveholder by marriage-right; and of all slaveholders these were by far the most exacting. There was in him all the love of domination, the pride of mastery, and the swagger of authority; but his rule lacked the vital element of consistency. He could be cruel; but his methods of showing it were cowardly, and evinced his  meanness, rather than his spirit. His commands were strong, his enforcements weak.             Slaves were not insensible to the whole-souled qualities of a generous, dashing slaveholder, who was fearless of  consequences, and they preferred a master of this bold and daring kind, even with the risk of being shot down for impudence, to the fretful little soul who never used the lash but at the suggestion of a love of gain.             Slaves too, readily distinguished between the birthright bearing of the original slaveholder, and the assumed attitudes of the accidental slaveholder; and while they could have no respect for either, they despised the latter more than the former.             The luxury of having slaves to wait upon him was new to Master Thomas, and for it he was wholly unprepared. He was a slaveholder, without the ability to hold or manage his slaves. Failing to command their respect, both himself and wife were ever on the alert lest some indignity should be offered him by the slaves.             It was in the month of August, 1833, when I had become almost desperate under the treatment of Master Thomas, and entertained more strongly than ever the oft-repeated determination  to run away,--a circumstance occurred which seemed to promise brighter and better days for us all. At a Methodist  camp-meeting, held in the Bay side (a famous place for camp-meetings) about eight miles from St. Michaels, Master Thomas came out with a profession of religion. He had long been an object of interest to the church, and to the ministers,           as I had seen by the repeated visits and lengthy exhortations of the latter. He was a fish quite worth catching, for he had money and standing. In the community of St. Michaels, he was equal to the best citizen. He was strictly temperate, and there was little to do for him, to give him the appearance of piety, and to make him a pillar of the church. Well, the camp-meeting continued a week; people gathered from all parts of the country, and two steamboats came loaded from Baltimore. The ground was happily chosen; seats were arranged; a stand erected; a rude altar fenced in, fronting the preacher's stand, with straw in it, making a soft kneeling-place  for the accommodation of mourners. This place would have held at least one hundred persons. In front and on the sides of the preacher's stand, and outside the long rows of seats, rose the first class of stately tents, each vieing with the other in strength, neatness, and capacity for accommodation. Behind this first circle of tents, was another less imposing, which reached round the camp-ground to the speaker's stand.  Outside this second class of tents were covered wagons, ox-carts, and vehicles of every shape and size. These served as tents to their owners. Outside of these, huge fires were burning in all directions, where roasting and boiling and frying were going on, for the benefit of those who were attending to their spiritual welfare within the circle.  Behind  the preacher's stand, a narrow space was marked out for the use of the colored people. There were no seats provided for this class of persons, and if the preachers addressed them at all, it was in an  aside . After the preaching was over, at every service, an invitation was given to mourners to come forward into the pen; and in some cases, ministers went out to persuade men and women to come in. By one of these ministers, Master Thomas was persuaded to go inside the pen. I was deeply interested in that matter, and followed; and though colored people were not allowed either in the pen, or in front of the preacher's stand, I ventured  to take my stand at a sort of half-way place between the blacks and whites, where I could distinctly see the movements           of the mourners, and especially the progress of Master Thomas.  If he has got religion,  thought I,  he will emancipate his slaves; or, if he should not do so much as this, he will at any rate behave towards us more kindly, and feed us more generously than he has heretofore done.  Appealing to my own religious experience, and judging my master by what was true in my own case, I could not regard him as soundly converted,  unless some such good results followed his profession of religion. But in my expectations I was doubly disappointed: Master Thomas was  Master Thomas  still. The fruits of his righteousness were to show themselves in no such way as I had anticipated. His conversion was not to change his relation  toward men--at any rate not toward BLACK men--but toward God. My faith, I confess, was not great. There was something in his appearance that in my mind cast a doubt over his conversion. Standing where I did, I could see his every movement. I watched very narrowly while he remained in the pen; and although I saw that his face was extremely red, and his hair disheveled, and though I heard him groan, and saw a stray tear halting on his cheek, as if inquiring,  which way shall I go? --I could not wholly confide in the genuineness of the conversion. The hesitating behavior of that tear-drop, and its loneliness, distressed me, and cast a doubt upon the whole transaction, of which it was a part. But people said,  Capt. Auld has come through,  and it was for me to hope for the best. I was bound to do this in charity, for I, too, was religious, and had been in the church full three years, although now I was not more than sixteen years old. Slaveholders might sometimes have confidence in the piety of some of their slaves, but the slaves seldom had confidence in the piety of their masters.  He can't go to heaven without blood on his skirts,  was a settled point in the creed of every slave; which rose superior to all teaching to the contrary, and stood forever as a fixed fact. The highest evidence the slaveholder  could give the slave of his acceptance with God, was the emancipation of his slaves. This was proof to us that he     
      Him. I turned to and drank again as usual. In 1853 I was living in the little town of Lamberton, Robertson Co., N.C., near the line of South Carolina, when the greatest revival broke out that I had ever seen, at a Methodist quarterly meeting, during the months of June and July. The people were going up and confessing their religion by scores [.]  God's spirit had been following me until that meeting. I thought at that revival I would seek my soul's salvation. At the revival, Peter Doubt, from Raleigh, preached a sermon. So Martin, of Franklin, preached a sermon. He had formerly been a circuit rider, and was now stationed in Lamberton, they said ruin this revival and the year 1853 will roll some of you into eternity. You may never have another opportunity. Ones' text  Bring my  sipirit  away from Ephriham for he is joined to his idols again.  Ones' text was,  Go your way, Saul,  says Felix,  and come at a more convenient season and I will hear thee,  and during that revival I felt that I was a lost man. I had been so; I felt like this before. But at this revival I could not feel. I attempted to pray, but could'nt pray. I sat then and found out it was all for nothing, it seemed to me the whole of the subject seemed for me. I was the guilty man. The whole of the argument was that God never let His spirit go back to Ephriham again, but left him there and gave him up to be lost and damned forever. Felix never saw Paul again to talk with him, and that was me; both cases seemed to suit me exactly.             On one occasion during the revival I stood up and shed tears like a child; I felt my sins and asked God to forgive me and I would never sin any more--I thought I was a lost man. I went or for weeks, crying and howling to God, going on that I was a lost man. This was in 1853. I attempted to pray and could not. I would up and go, lie down by a place, get up and try it again; no relief for me yet. I would go out during the dark hours of the night, away in a lonesome place to pray. I asked God if he had drawn His spirit away from me and left me to be damned, to show it to me. He manifested that He had not drawn His Holy Spirit from me. You could hear me cry aloud, I was so rejoiced that I could be saved.             In 1854 I professed religion at my work in the woods. I forget the day of the month. In November, 1855, I was baptized ; many sore trials from June 1853 to 1855. They attempted to whip me in 1854 and backed me down but I continued to pray night and day. A  company of men hired me that year--gave Dr. Rogers $300 for me a year. When they did this, I looked at them wistfully, and when they talked of whipping me, I told them to back me down and get their shooting works ready and kill or cripple me and pay for me, for I did not let Dr. Rogers whip me and would not let anyone else do it. I went home to him on or about, the 4th of July, and told him I wanted to leave and must leave. He said that it was a good note, and for me to and stay the year out, as he did not want to take his note in. I answered him and said if he did not want to take his note in I was man enough to take care of myself.             I went back a few days after the 4th of July, but before this time I had professed a hope. I do this to show to men that no devil has the power to keep a man from praying if he is in earnest. In     
      that sin to the extent that its laity vote to sustain the laws that uphold it. It is the duty of a king to rule in righteousness. But the people are the rulers in this government; therefore, they should rule in righteousness.      CAMP-MEETINGS.             Camp-meetings in the South are held almost exclusively by the Methodist churches. The primary design of these meetings was the glory of God and the salvation of souls. They are generally held in the summer time--in some central position, on an elevated spot, shaded with beautiful oak and hickory trees, and where water can easily be obtained. The camp consists of a circle of tents, numbering from fifty to three hundred, made of plank or canvas. The space included within the first circle of tents, excepting the avenue for walking or promenading, is consecrated to religious worship. Within this inclosure a rough and substantial pulpit is erected, immediately in front of which is a place denominated the altar, where those who seek the forgiveness of their sins come forward to be prayed for. Still further on are seats for the white congregation.           Behind the pulpit, and separated by a board fence, is the place allotted for the colored people, who labor under the disadvantage of not catching the inspiration which darts from the eye of an earnest orator, or beams from a countenance irradiated by heavenly enthusiasm.             Camp-meetings are, of all meetings held by Methodists, the most exciting and popular.             1. With the preachers, and the most spiritual members of the church. But few men are great orators before small assemblies. If a man has the  gift divine,  he is very apt to develop it at a camp-meeting, where thousands dwell upon his tongue. Perhaps the greatest displays of American pulpit eloquence have been witnessed at camp-meetings. Here the preachers generally do their best, and cultivate toward each other kind feelings. Here, with many young ministers, springs up an intimacy with ladies who subsequently prove to be their companions for life. Here the private members from different circuits and stations become acquainted with each other, and reap mutual benefits from each other's talents, zeal, and spirituality.                     2. With money-making Methodists, who can keep a horse-pound, a boarding-tent, and a bread-stall, and retail tobacco, pipes, and cigars.             3. With the worldly; with the politician who goes to confirm a doubtful voter; with the constable and collector, who are thus afforded a convenient opportunity to catch an old debtor; with the dandy and the beau, who seize the occasion to exhibit the latest fashion of coat and cane; with numbers of young, beautiful, and accomplished ladies, who, arrayed in rich and costly attire, spend their golden moments in thoughtless levity. Here, also, like vultures flocking to a carcass, come the licentious from the surrounding country.             But by no class is a camp-meeting hailed with more unmixed delight than by the poor slaves. It comes at a season of the year when they most need rest. It gives them all the advantages of an ordinary holiday, without its accompaniments of drunkenness and profanity. Here they get to see their mothers, their brothers, and their sisters from neighboring plantations;          here they can sing and jump to their hearts' content.             When properly conducted, more can be said in favor of camp-meetings than against them. I have witnessed scenes at these meetings morally grand and sublime--scenes which can never be blotted from my memory. Camp-fires blazing in every direction with heart pine wood; the groans and the sobs of penitent sinners; the shout and the rapture of the new convert; the rejoicing of friends; the deep, melodious, organ-like music welling from a thousand African throats--all conspired to elevate the soul to Christ,  who sitteth at the right hand of the Father.       LOVE-FEASTS.             Love-feasts, in the Methodist Episcopal Church, are held once a quarter, at the visitation of the Presiding Elder of the district. They usually commence at nine o'clock on Sabbath morning, and close before eleven. Members of the church, far and near, are admitted to them. The Elder, after opening the meeting, authorizes two or four male members to hand round bread and water,           in token of equality and brotherly love. This being done, the meeting is conducted on the principle pursued at a Friends' or Quaker Meeting; no one is called on to speak; and those who do speak are supposed to be moved thereto by the drawings of the Holy Spirit. The young are not to wait for the aged, nor are the women to wait for the men. Nevertheless, in Delaware and Maryland, when colored members are present, no matter what may be their age or experience, they dare not speak till the Presiding Elder closes for the whites, and announces to them that they are at liberty to relate their experience. Out of two hours they have thirty minutes. The Spirit is supposed to move the white members at pleasure, but not the colored people till the Elder gives them liberty to speak; or, if the Spirit does move them before the permission thus given, they are compelled to quench its promptings.             Among the Wesleyans in England no such restriction exists. But with us slavery intrudes itself into the vestibule of heaven; for I consider a properly conducted love-feast an antepast of glory.      
      quantity of brandy to harden his heart that he might kill him; but he never had power to strike nor shoot him, and he would freely give the world, if he had it in his possession for what he believed his Jacob to possess. He also thought that Jacob was as sure of Heaven as the apostle Paul or Peter. Sometimes Mr. S. would be in the field about half drunk, raging like a madman, whipping the other slaves; and when Jacob's hour would come for prayer, he would stop his horses and plough and kneel down and pray; but he could not strike the man of God.             The first Methodist minister that ever preached. in a certain town in Queen Ann's county, there was a great revival of religion among the rich and poor, black and white, free and slaves. When many of them experienced religion they would disobey their ungodly masters and would go to meetings nights and Sundays. Two rich slaveholders waylaid the           minister at night, and taking him off from his horse and beat him until they thought he was dead. But the Lord saved his life to preach his Word, and many were converted in the same town through his preaching, and many masters, when converted, set their slaves free.             My grandmother died at ninety years of age; my mother at seventy, and my father at eighty years of age. These three friends died in the strongest triumph of faith in Jesus, who when on earth said he would be with his people to the end of the world. Amen.             Perhaps some person will ask why did I teach the art of wrestling, boxing and fighting, when desirous to learn to read the Bible? I answer because no one is so contemptible as a coward. With us a coward is looked upon as the most degraded wretch on earth, and is only worthy to be a slave. My brother's master, Governor R. Right, of Maryland, taught his children never to take an insult from one of     
   slaves, and see that they were dressed well, had plenty of food, and to oil their faces.  During this time, we stopped once at White House Church, a Baptist association; a protracted camp meeting was holding there, on the plan of the revival meetings in this country.  We got there at the time of the meeting, and sold two female slaves on the Sunday morning, at the time the meeting broke up, to a gentleman who had been attending the meeting the whole of the week. While I was with Mr. Rowland we were at many such meetings, and the members of the churches are by this means so well influenced towards their fellow creatures, at these meetings for the worship of God, that it becomes a fruitful season for the drover, who carries on immense traffic with the attendants at these places.  This is common to Baptists and Methodists.  At the end of the year he exchanged me to a farmer, Mr. David Goodley, for a female slave, in Greenville,  about fourteen miles from Greenville Courthouse.   The gentleman was going to Missouri to settle, and on his way had to pass through Ohio, a free state.  But having learnt, after he bought me, that I had before tried to get away to     
      think they never agreed upon the question of having slaves.  She did not like the idea of owning slaves. She was a good  Christian woman and she believed the Bible did not teach  that it was right to own slaves. Shortly before her death  an incident occurred which made a very great impression upon  all of us for more reasons than one. She was very sick and  one day she called Frank, the carpenter, and who as the head  slave had charge of the others, and told him to bring into  her room all the slaves he could find on the plantation. They  were shelling corn at the time, getting it ready to ship to  the market, and he brought in as many as he could get  together, I suppose, in a short time. I was not one of them,  but I was later told by the others what happened. She said  to them,  Be good and do your work and the time will come  when you will all be free. The North is not satisfied with  slavery.  My master's brother was present and heard this and  after that we were treated very much worse than before.  Whenever they saw a group of us standing together they would  come up and make us disperse for fear we were going to raise  against them. Shortly after that our mistress died and on  the day of the funeral all of us slaves on the plantation,  between seventy-five and a hundred, men, women and children,  followed her body to the cemetery, about five miles away,  where she was buried.             It was a very sad occasion, for all the women were crying and  most of the men too, as well as the children. We knew that  she was the best friend we had and that now our lot would be  harder. Shortly after that my master married again, but our  new mistress did not have the kind heart our old mistress  had had.             I do not remember just the year our mistress died and told us  that we would some time be free, but I think it was about  1858. At any rate, it was not long before we began to hear  talk of a war. Our masters were afraid that there would be  a war. They kept talking against the North. They told us that  the white people in the North were nothing but shop slaves.  That the white girls were slaves who did the house work for  the Northern people and that the Northern people were not  considered as high class people as the Southern people. It  was about this time, too, that we first heard of a man named  Lincoln. They said he was a bad man and that he had horns.  Another man we heard about was John Brown and the underground  railroad. Of course we did not understand what the  underground railroad was. We thought it was some sort of a  road under the ground. We only knew, of course, what we were  told. We could not read or write and if any of us had tried  to learn to read or write we would have been severely  punished. One reason for the prejudice which the plantation  owners had against the poor white people in every community  was that these poor white people naturally sympathized with  us and the plantation owners were afraid that because of this  they might teach us to read or might give us some information  about what the North was trying to do. So we learned little  about the outside world. We did learn, however, that a man  named Wendell Phillips and a man named Garrison were getting  slaves into Canada and we were told that once you got into  Canada they could not get you back again, that you were free.  Of course the slaves as a whole wanted to be free. Many of  them were not treated well and the thought of being sold was  a very burdensome thing. The slaves on our plantation had  been told that they were going to be free, and they were  looking for what their mistress had said to come true. Then  Colonel Nelson, who owned an adjoining plantation, set all  his slaves free by his will when he died and they were all  sent to Liberia. There were about seventy-five of them. And  we were anxious to be free too.              I do not mean by all this that our life was altogether bad.  We had enough to eat and we had certain pleasures. It was a  common thing for the slaves to have parties where the slaves  from adjoining plantations came together and danced and sang  and played. The masters encouraged these parties for the  purpose of getting the young men and women slaves acquainted  with one another. They were looked forward to with pleasure,  for they were the chief social events.             Another thing we liked to do was attend the camp meetings. We  liked the singing and speaking. And then it was something for  us to go to. One of the worst features of slavery was that  the slaves on a plantation were virtually in prison. They  could not leave the plantation except with the            consent of their masters. Then no matter how hard they worked  they had nothing which they could call their own. Even their  children did not belong to them. And they themselves were  liable to be sold away to a distant part of the country to a  master whom they did not know and who might be very cruel to  them. Then as there were no schools for us and as we could  not read you can see how we would want to go to camp meetings  or to church. So we were always glad when Sunday came. On  Sunday, masters and slaves all went to church together.             Our master was a very religious man, being a local preacher  in the Methodist church. Once every three months the  Presiding Elder used to visit the church and hold a quarterly  meeting after he had preached. On one of those visits an  incident occurred that I still remember even after so many  years. It showed how bitter our masters were toward any one  who sympathized with us. And it marked, too, the breaking off  of religious association between our part of the South and  the North.      III             I cannot remember when the church incident with relation to  the Presiding Elder occurred, but it could not have been so  very long before the beginning of the war. We slaves used to  go to the same church our master and the other plantation  owners attended. Of course we used to sit back by the door  by ourselves while they sat up front. The church was about  five miles away from our plantation. We slaves used to walk  while our masters rode. This Sunday for some reason they  left me at home. But after they were gone I happened to  think of a donkey I often rode and the thought occurred to me  that I might ride him to church. So I got on his back and  started off. He carried me to church in good style but when  we reached there instead of waiting for me to get off he  threw me off. I had no rope to tie him, so I left him outside  and went in the church. The result was that he got in a fight  with another donkey while the church services was in progress  and created such a disturbance that I was later given a  severe whipping for it.             But another thing happened during that service which caused  a greater commotion than my donkey. Mr. Ayers, the Presiding  Elder, called upon a colored man named Ennis Dilamar to pray.  Ennis was a slave who had recently been purchased by my  master and who had quite a local reputation as a religious  man. The fact that Mr. Ayers should call upon a slave to pray  caused great offense to the plantation owners and after the  service was over and while the masters and their families  were arranging themselves on the ground to eat their dinner,  my master called Ennis to him and asked him what he meant by  asking God to send the time when Ethiopia should stretch  forth her arm like an army with banners, and said that he  would teach him better than to use such words as that. Of  course Ennis could not make any reply to this. He had simply  been repeating what he had heard some white man say, because  he himself could neither read nor write. However, they gave  him a severe whipping right then and there. This seemed to  disturb Mr. Ayers very much. He withdrew from the company and  went over to where the slaves were preparing their dinner and  told them that he did not see why a Christian man could not  be allowed to use his gift of prayer even if he was black.  In some way this remark got to the white people. So when the  afternoon meeting was called my master told Mr. Ayers that  his service was no longer wanted and that he need not visit  the church any more. From that time on my master had charge  of the meetings as local preacher and we never saw Mr. Ayers  again.             This incident, as I say, must have happened a short time  before the beginning of the war, because shortly afterwards  Samuel Hymans, a young man from our community who was  attending West Point, came home for a vacation, but when the  vacation was over he did not return to West Point. Instead  he commenced to organize a company of soldiers. I was very  anxious to go with him as his servant and my master, at his  request, let me do so. The reason why I was anxious to go  with Hymans was because I wanted to learn how to drill. I did  learn to drill. In fact I learned how to drill so well that  after a while when he was busy with other matters he would  tell me to drill the company for him. After Fort Sumpter      
              When the master came in, he wanted to know what we were doing there, and asked me if I knew that it was against the law for niggers to hold meetings. I expected every moment that he would fly at me with his cane; he did not, but only threatened to report me to my master. He soon left us to ourselves, and this was the last time be disturbed us in our meetings. His object in interrupting us was to find out whether we were plotting some scheme to raise an insurrection among the people. Before this, the white people held a quarterly meeting in the Fairfield Church, commencing Saturday, and continuing eight days and nights without cessation.             The religious excitement that existed at that time was so great that the people did not leave the church for their meals, but had them brought to them. There were many souls converted. The colored people attended every night. The white people occupied the part next to the altar, while the colored people took the part assigned them next to the door, where they held a protracted meeting among themselves. Sometimes, while we were praying, the white people would be singing, and when we were singing they would be praying; each gave full vent to their feelings, yet there was no discord or interruption with the two services. On Wednesday night, the fourth day from the commencement of the meeting, a colored woman by the name of Nancy Merrill, was converted, and when she experienced a change of heart she shouted aloud, rejoicing in the richness of her new found hope. Thursday night, the next evening, the meeting still continued.             By this time the excitement was on the increase           among both parties, and it bid fair to hold eight days longer; but right in the midst of the excitement some one came to the door of the church and nodded to the sexton to come to the door; as soon as he did go to the door some one there told him to speak to Nancy Merrill, the new convert, and tell her to come to the door, for he wanted to speak to her. She went, and, behold it was a slave trader, who had bought her during the day from her mistress! As soon as she went to the door, he seized and bound her, and then took her off to her cabin home to get her two boys he had bought also. The sexton came back and reported to us what had taken place.             This thrilling and shocking news sent a sharp shiver through every heart; it went through the church like wild-fire; it broke up the meeting entirely among both parties; in less than half an hour every one left the church for home. This woman had a daughter in Fairfield, where I learned my trade, and I hastened home, as soon as possible, to tell the girl what had happened to her mother. She was standing by the fire in the kitchen as I entered--she was the servant girl of John Langsdon, the man who taught me the shoemaker's trade. As soon as I related to her this sad news she fell to the floor as though she had been shot by a pistol; and, as soon as she had recovered a little from the shock we started for her mother's cabin home, reaching there just in time to see her mother and her two brothers take the vessel for Norfolk, to be sold. This was the last time we ever saw her; we heard, sometime afterwards, that a kind master had bought her and that she was doing well.       
     of which, as he fancied, I often got severe floggings from him. Still, I did not wish my situation changed, for I considered my station a very high one; preferring an occasional licking, to being thrown out of office.             Being a gentleman's body servant, I had nothing more to do with plantation affairs, and, consequently, thought myself much superior to those children who had to sweep the yard. I was about twelve years old when given to John Wagar.      CHAP. IV.             FIDDLING and dancing being done away with among the slaves, by the disappearance of Martin's fiddle, Christianity seemed to gain ground, and a glorious revival of religion sprang up, which required another legal provision to suppress. This was the new provision: that the patrolers should search the slave quarters, on every plantation, from whence, if they found any slaves absent after night fall, they should receive, when found, thirty-nine lashes upon the naked back. When the slaves were caught, if a constable were present, he could administer the punishment immediately. If no constable were present, then the truant slave must be taken before a justice of the peace, where he must receive not less than five, nor more than thirty-nine lashes, unless he could show a pass, either from his master or his overseer. Many were      
      prayer for colleges. At this concert, in the year 1834, a six o'clock morning prayer-meeting was appointed. When the pastor came, he found that Phebe had been there,  on the door steps more than an hour praying!  While it was yet dark, she found her way to the  prayer-meeting, as Mary to the sepulchre. Who can tell how many souls were converted in answer to the prayers on that door-step--how much they had to do with those conversions  in college which occurred at this time, and the fruits of which may be seen in the ministers scattered abroad, preaching the gospel, gathering souls into the kingdom of Christ? Those  seasons of revivals in college, have they no connection with the prayers of this humble saint, who lived to pray: lived in obscurity, and yet lived for the college; lived for the  church; lived for the pastor; lived for the world?             Phebe  loved the church and female prayer-meeting.  Through the storm and wind and bad walking, she would find her way to the place of prayer. In the female prayer-meeting, all  loved to kneel when Phebe prayed. She approached the throne of grace as if her mind and heart were already there, and she had only to open her lips and the prayer of the heart  ascended, in humility and faith and love. The last Sabbath she spent on earth she was at church as usual, and stopped at noon, and was conversing on the value and importance of  this meeting. She then alluded to a time, about four years since, when  she could not hold her peace.  About this time Phebe seemed more fully than ever before to receive Christ as  an all-sufficient, present Saviour. The blessings of His salvation seemed as much her own, as if she alone was heir to the redemption purchased by Christ. She  knew in whom she  believed,  and that  He was able to make all grace abound toward her.  Grace was triumphant in her soul, and so continued, by her own testimony given at her last interview  with her Christian friends. From this time, as she often expressed it,  she had never let her Saviour go;   she had held Him by the hand,  nay more,  He had come into her heart, and continued      
       CHAPTER III.     RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCES.           I COME now to a phase in my experience which aroused the impressions made upon me so long before in the blackberry pasture.           At Powell's Fort, not far from where I now lived, was the Mount Asa school-house, where the different religious denominations held their meetings. My master's brother, Jerry Kibbler, and his sister Sally had been to a camp-meeting, and got  religion.  They came home determined their religion should help others; and, through their influence, this little school-house had been fitted up with pulpit and seats, and now there was to be a series of revival meetings held there. I had never been to any kind of a meeting since I was a little girl, and then my mistress had sometimes taken me along for company.           At this time, Miss Ellen Mills was spinning wool at Mr. Jonathan Grandstaff's; and one night, as it was growing dusk, she came down to master's, to see if some of the family would go to meeting with her. No one cared to go; and Miss Lucy, turning to me, said:  There is Betty. Take Betty. She will be company for you.  So I went. The minister was preaching when we entered; and I have no recollection of anything he said in his sermon, but, when he took his seat, he sang the hymn,  -           Then let this feeble body fail,              It was a hymn of many verses (I afterwards got an old woman to teach them to me); and there was such tenderness in his voice and such solemnity in his manner that I was greatly affected. When the singing was over, he moved about among the congregation; and, coming close to me, he said,  Girl, don't you want religion? don't you want to be happy when you die?  Then he asked me to promise him that, when I got home, I would go upon my knees and ask God to give me the witness that I was his. I made him no answer; but, as soon as I reached home and was alone, I knelt down, and in my feeble and ignorant way begged to be saved. From that day to this, I have been praying and trying to do as I thought my heavenly Master has required of me; and I think I have had the witness of the Spirit.           So, night after night, I went to the little school-house, and had many precious seasons. Master Jerry and Miss Sally were very kind to me, and tried to show me the way to be a Christian.           But there came a time when Master David said he was not going  to have me running to meeting all the time any longer. He had decided  to send me up to old Mr. Levers, two miles away, there to stay until  I should get over my  religious fever,  as he called it. Accordingly,  I went as directed; but, when it came night, I asked if I might go  down to Mount Asa school-house for meeting. The old     
     the only educated and refined person who ever noticed her, the only one to whom she looked up as to a  superior being, telling her that there was  no hereafter;   that she had only to work by day and sleep by night, till  at last she would drop into the ground and crumble  to dust like the autumn leaves, Ah! there is One  who never slumbers, and the poorest and most neglected  child is as dear to Him as the loftiest king. He who feedeth  the young ravens when they cry, and without  whose notice not a sparrow falls to the ground,  was even then preparing her for rest and joy  through knowledge of Him.            September came, and with it a series of camp meetings. There was great joy on the plantation when it was announced that one was to be held in the immediate vicinity of Fayetteville. It was years since such a thing  had happened, and all the servants had the promise of spending a day at least on the camp-ground. As it was only two miles distant it was  easy for them to go and come, according to  the wish of the master. Sally was wild  with delight. She should see something of  the  great world, whose faint murmur sometimes reached the plantation [.]  There          would be the handsome carriages which occasionally drove up to her mistress' door, and the fine ladies and gentlemen with their servants, from all the country round, and so many preachers, and such singing--it was bewildering to think of!            The important week came with cloudless skies. It was arranged that the servants should attend the meeting in turn, and Sally was not to go until the last day, Friday, Her excitement was in no degree lessened by the  glowing accounts of those who preceded her. She could hardly wait for the time to arrive. Her calico dress was smoothed, a new ribbon was tied over her bonnet, and at five o'clock on Thursday afternoon she was ready to start with the others, in order to spend the night on the ground. How happy she was to have a week-time holiday, and to walk so blithe and free across the fields! Beneath this outward gladness, too, there was an undefined hope that she might obtain something to satisfy the craving of her nature. With snatches of hymns and merry words to her companions, she beguiled the way. An occasional tree obstructed the view, but at length she began to hear the faint hum of voices, and          soon a quick turn in the path revealed the scene. A pleasant pine-grove had been chosen for the camp, and the white tents gleamed here and there through the dusky boughs. The horses and carriages were grouped upon the outskirts, and in the center many hundreds of men, women, and children were gathered round the preacher's stand, in the red light of the setting sun. A solemn hush was over the assembly, and as Sally drew nearer, the wind bore to her ear the words of the hymn with which the services  were concluding:       O! every weary, wounded soul,           The judgment day is stealing on,                          The music and the somber pines brought back that other evening when she had soon her little playmate buried, and the tears rolled down her cheeks as she passed through the crowd and sought the tent belonging to her master.            The wind sighed all night through the trees, and the stars shone overhead. Sally lay down to sleep upon the straw floor, sorely puzzled to reconcile what she heard about the mysterious future. In her dreams, she thought her young master died, but came to her again in the garden-path, looking wan and wretched, and told her, in a voice like the wind in the pines, that he had been mistaken; that there  was  a hereafter, and that she must take warning by his miserable fate, and prepare to meet it. Then she thought she lay calmly on her own death-bed, and all who stood around rejoiced with her that her toilsome days were over, and that she was sinking into the sleep from which no master's call could rouse her, and from which she never could rise to pain.            The sun shone brightly into the tent, and she woke. The morning was glorious out there in the forest. The birds sang and the dew glistened, as they might have done in          Eden when the world was young. The early meal was soon despatched, and the tents put in order, for a, new preacher was expected, and the closing exercises were eagerly anticipated by all. Carriages began to arrive, and by ten o'clock a vast congregation had assembled in the grove. Just in front of the platform sat Sally, in a seat which she had taken pains to secure an hour before. The people were becoming impatient, when a murmur was heard, and the expected preacher, who had ridden hastily from another meeting, passed through the crowd and gained the stand. He was a tall, slender man, with an impetuous manner, and a face which seemed to say:     Be earnest, earnest., earnest;                He throw aside his traveling coat, and without delay began to sing, in a rich, minor voice, these words:      Hark! 'tis the trump of judgment   Perhaps you do not hear it,                   There was no heart that was not awed by the solemn music, and every head was bowed, as the preacher knelt to pray. Sally had never heard such a prayer, It was the outpouring of a heart that said--  I will not lot thee go except thou bless me,  me and all this waiting congregation. It was talking with God as friend talks with friend, till Sally believed in His existence with her whole soul, and expected to see Him appear in the parted sky, and answer with audible voice the strong petition. When it was ended, the preacher rose, and, opening the Bible, read the parable of the tares of the field, selecting for his text the closing verses:            The Son of man shall send forth His           angels, and they shall gather out of His kingdom all things that offend, and them which do  iniquity, and shall cast them into a furnace of fire; there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.            There shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.             There was no logical introduction, no display of doctrines, but the truth was sent straight home to every hearer as if he, and  the speaker, and God alone were present. In  simple words, and with imagery drawn from the scenes about them, the preacher portrayed  their duty and their danger.  This  morning,  said he,  as I was riding through the forest, I saw a  bird trembling and fluttering in the snare of a serpent.  It would have been devoured had I not sprung from my horse and killed the monster.  Ah! thought I, this is just the way the devil snares poor sinners. Those of you who are in high stations he charms with riches, and honors, and worldly ease; and to those who are poor, and have little to hope for in life he whispers, 'You have no need to trouble yourselves about doing right; you must take what           comfort you can now, and rely upon happiness  hereafter;' or else, he tells you, 'You may do  as you please, for death will end your existence.'  No matter what he says, you are in  his power, and he is luring you on to destruction,  and unless you call to Christ to vanquish him with speedy blows, he will swallow you up in infinite ruin.             Sometimes he rose to a higher, wilder strain.  Did you ever think what it would be to be cast out for ever from God? If it were for a million of years, you could endure that; but  for ever! --that is unbearable. What is hell? Why, it is a great burning desert, over which the lost wander without shelter, or cooling draught, or momentary repose, unable to be quiet because of the fires of rage and remorse that torment them from within. In the center of this desert there rises a mountain, and on it is a huge clock. Once in a thousand years it strikes one, and as the mournful sound vibrates through the burning air, the wretched souls shriek out in echo, Eternity just begun! Eternity just begun!             Having, with rapid gesture and passionate utterance, pictured the condition of the sinner, he began to speak in gentle tones of  the           Lamb of God, who taketh away the sins of the world.  And he sang:       Whose is that voice so kind and sweet,    And can the Lord of glory mean   He will; and when this life is o'er,              Sally had listened with her whole soul to the preacher, and now these tender words quite overpowered her. Was she not a sinner? Had she not a heavy load to bear? Did she not yearn for sympathy and rest? She looked up with streaming eyes and saw just before  her her  young master, who, out of idle curiosity, had come to the camp ground. In spite of his irreligion, he was momentarily affected by the scene.                      So you like this, Sally?              O mas'r! 'pears like it's what I's been wantin' dis long time.              Well, well,  he answered, as he turned away,  get it if you can.             There was a fervent prayer that none there assembled might be among the lost in the Great Day, and then with shouts, and sobs, and fervent ejaculations, the meeting broke up.            It was almost dark when the servants reached the plantation. In distress and uncertainty Sally lay down that night to sleep, and, for the first time in her life, tried to pray. So guilty did she feel herself, that she would not have dared to do it, if that gentle invitation had not rung in her ears--     Sinner, come to me,                In dreams she lived over the excitements of the day. She was aroused in the morning by the call to labor, and, bewildered, hurried to her plowing in the field. She was not the only anxious one. Many of the servants were awakened, and the usual merriment was hushed. Silently she went her weary rounds. She wanted the Savior, but she know not     
   and, after a conference, Schenk called Quamino into the parlor, and queried whether he would like to see his father and mother, his master and mistress, his young masters and mistresses,  c. On his giving an affirmative reply, he was told:-- Well, your master has sent for you, and this man has come to take you.  Overcome with this too sudden announcement, he burst into a violent and uncontrollable fit of crying, and for hours cried aloud as though he had been beaten--unable to answer questions, or to stay his emotions at the kindest efforts to pacify him.  Oh,  said his master,  the shock was too much for him.  And he continued to sob the remainder of the day, whilst endeavouring to perform his work. As he related it, in his venerable age, to the writer, he was asked whether it was joy that affected him. He replied,  It seems so, sir--I don't know, and  I didn't know then --it struck me to the heart.            On his return to Jersey, his young associates were so grown beyond his knowledge, that he felt like a stranger in his childish haunts.           When nearing the age of manhood, he was steady in his attendance upon religious meetings, walking several miles through all kinds of weather. His own account of the motive for going was, that he  liked to have the name of being a good boy.  One Sabbath evening, returning home from meeting, he had impressions of a striking character; his imagination being evidently much acted upon.     
              In giving the foregoing brief sketch of the life and character of Joice Heth, the writer of this has but one single motive, and that is of charity towards the descendants of this living monument of antiquity.             She has outlived all her descendants save five, and they are her great grand-children, who are now held in bondage by a respectable gentleman of Kentucky, who has generously offered to set them free on being paid two-thirds they cost him. This work, together with what may be collected from exhibition, after deducting expenses, is expressly for that purpose, and will be immediately done whenever there can be realized the sum to do it. Two of them are said to be uncommonly intelligent and active, quick to learn, and great favorites of their master. In consequence of his partiality towards them, they have been instructed to read, and have acquired by their assiduous application upon the Sabbath, a knowledge of the scriptures, of which they are very fond to learn. It is designed that they shall be instructed in the glorious truths of the gospel, so as to become fully qualified to teach their poor unfortunate race the true way to future happiness.             If such should be the case, the writer of this little work would feel himself amply compensated for all his labor, by the happy reflection of having been instrumental, through the favor of the Lord, in opening a new channel through which might flow freely and effectually to those unfortunate beings, the glorious     
     who ever retained the most lively sense of gratitude towards his benefactor.            Toussaint was now a happy man, considering his condition as a slave--the husband of a slave--a very happy man. His position  gave him privileges, and he had a heart to enjoy them. His leisure hours  he employed in cultivating a garden, which he was allowed to call his own. In those pleasing engagements he was not without a companion.  We went,  he said to a traveler,  we went to labour in the fields, my wife and I, hand in hand. Scarcely were we conscious of the fatigues of the day. Heaven always blessed our toil. Not only we swam in abundance, but we had the pleasure of giving food to blacks who needed it. On the Sabbath and on festival days we went to church--my wife, my parents, and myself. Returning to our cottage, after a pleasant meal, we passed the remainder of the day as a family, and we closed it by prayer, in which all took part.  Thus can religion convert a desert into a garden, and make a slave's cabin the abode of the purest happiness on earth.            Bent as Toussaint was on the improvement of his condition, he yet did not employ the personal property which ensued from his own and his wife's thrift, in purchasing his liberty, and elevating himself and family into the higher class of men of colour. His reasons for remaining a slave are not recorded. He may have felt no attractions towards a class whose superiority was more nominal than real. He may have resolved to remain in a class whose emancipation he hoped some day to achieve.            The virtues of his character procured for Toussaint universal respect. He was esteemed and loved even by the free blacks. The great planters held him in consideration. His intellectual faculties ripened under the effects of his intercourse with free and white men. As he grew in mind and became large of heart, he more and more was puzzled and distressed with the institution of slavery; he could in no way understand how the hue of the skin should put so great a social and personal distance between men whom God, he saw, had made essentially the same, and whom he knew to be useful if not indispensable to each        
      CHAPTER II.              A fruitless effort for education.--The Sabbath among Slaves.-- Degrading amusements.--Why religion is rejected.--Condition of poor white people.--Superstition among slaves.--Education forbidden.              IN 1833, I had some very serious religious impressions, and there was quite a number of slaves in that neighborhood, who felt very desirous to be taught to read the Bible. There was a Miss Davis, a poor white girl, who offered to teach a Sabbath School for the slaves, notwithstanding public opinion and the law was opposed to it. Books were furnished and she commenced the school; but the news soon got to our owners that she was teaching us to read. This caused quite an excitement in the neighborhood. Patrols  *               *Police peculiar to the South.    were appointed to go and break it up the next Sabbath. They were determined that we should not have a Sabbath School in operation. For slaves this was called an incendiary Movement.             The Sabbath is not regarded by a large number of the slaves as a day of rest. They have no schools to go to; no moral nor religious instruction at all in many localities where there are hundreds of                The Sabbath among Slaves.              slaves. Hence they resort to some kind of amusement. Those who make no profession of religion, resort to the woods in large numbers on that day to gamble, fight, get drunk, and break the Sabbath. This is often encouraged by slaveholders. When they wish to have a little sport of that kind, they go among the slaves and give them whiskey, to see them dance,  pat juber,  sing and play on the banjo. Then get them to wrestling, fighting, jumping, running foot races, and butting each other like sheep. This is urged on by giving them whiskey; making bets on them; laying chips on one slave's head, and daring another to tip it off with his hand; and if he tipped it off, it be called an insult, and cause a fight. Before fighting, the parties choose their seconds to stand by them while fighting; a ring or a circle is formed to fight in, and no one is allowed to enter the ring while they are fighting, but their seconds, and the white gentlemen. They are not allowed to fight a duel, nor to use weapons any kind. The blows are made by kicking, knocking, and butting with their heads; they grab each other by their ears, and jam their heads together like sheep. If they are likely to hurt each other very bad, their masters would rap them with their walking canes, and make them stop. After fighting, they make friends, shake hands, and take a dram together, and there is no more of it.             But this is all principally for want of moral instruction. This is where they have no Sabbath Schools; no one to read the Bible to them; no one to preach the gospel who is competent to expound          the Scriptures, except slaveholders. And the slaves, with but few exceptions, have no confidence at all in their preaching because they preach a pro-slavery doctrine. They say,  Servants be obedient to your masters;--and he that knoweth his masters will and doeth it not, shall be beaten with many stripes-- means that God will send them to hell, if they disobey their masters. This kind of preaching has driven thousands into infidelity. They view themselves as suffering unjustly under the lash, without friends, without protection, of law or gospel, and the green eyed monster tyranny staring them in the face. They know that they are destined to die in that wretched condition, unless they are delivered by the arm of omnipotence. And they cannot believe or trust in such a religion, as above named.             The poor and loafering class of whites, are about on a par in point of morals with the slaves at the South. They are generally ignorant, intemperate, licentious, and profane. They associate much with the slaves; are often found gambling together on the Sabbath; encouraging slaves to steal from their owners, and sell to them, corn, wheat, sheep, chickens or any thing of the kind which they can well conceal. For such offences there is no law to reach a slave but lynch law. But if both parties are caught in the act by a white person, the slave is punished with the lash, while the white man is often punished with both lynch and common law. But there is another class of poor white people in the South, who, I think would be glad to see slavery abolished in self defence; they despise the institution     
     and who, that casts his eye back through the dark, bloody track of slavery, does not perceive that the masters have acted up to their interest? We sometimes had cider; occasionally some meat and milk, as it might happen.             We remembered what our brothers told us--when we were able to run away, to try it on some favorable Sunday. The old man would let us go to meeting on Sunday at the village, but if we were not at home by sundown, the cowhide paid the debt. We were slaves yet, and the old man grew poorer and poorer the older he grew, and withal cross, much to our discomfort. He had a wife like king Herod, and like Ahab, for we read that Beelzebub stirred up Ahab to work evil in the sight of the Lord.             Finally the old lady teased her husband to put my brother Nick out; and he let him out for ten dollars a month. I was at home with two women and a boy to carry on the farm,     
     to God, nor to read the blessed Bible. She was, it is true, sent to meeting half the day on the Sabbath;  but the seat assigned to herself  and her associates was remote from the view of the congregation; and she confessed, that as they did not understand the preaching, they took no interest in it, and spent the time in playing, eating nuts,  c. and derived no benefit whatever, though the preaching probably was evangelical.             It was close personal instruction that she needed, to discover to her the beauty of religion, and her condition as a sinner. This she did not receive. But, being favoured by the munificent Author of her existence, with superior intellectual powers, which, if cultivated, would     
    the medical profession. Nevertheless, the son often said that he believed God had destined him for the sacred calling, and devoted much of his time in exhorting his neighbors to seek repentance.            Most planters in our section cared but little about the religious training of their slaves, regarding them as they did their cattle,--an investment, the return of which was only to be considered in dollars and cents. Not so, however, with Dr. John Gaines, for he took special pride in looking after the spiritual welfare of his slaves, having them all in the  great house,  at family worship, night and morning.            On Sabbath mornings, reading of the Scriptures, and explaining the same, generally occupied from one to two hours, and often till half of the negroes present were fast asleep. The white members of the family did not take as kindly to the religious teaching of the doctor, as did the blacks.            For his Christian zeal, I had the greatest respect, for I always regarded him as a truly pious and conscientious man, willing at all times to give of his means the needful in spreading the Gospel.            Mrs. Sarah Gaines was a lady of considerable merit, well-educated, and of undoubted piety. If she did not join heartily in her husband's religious enthusiasm, it was not for want of deep and genuine Christian feeling, but from the idea that he was of more humble origin than herself, and, therefore, was not a capable instructor.            This difference in birth, this difference in antecedents does much in the South to disturb family relations     
  only tried to please them, but I think he succeeded admirably. When they wanted singing, he sung; when they wanted praying, he prayed; when they wanted a story told, he told a story. Instead of his teaching my master theology, my master taught theology to him. While I was with Captain  Reynolds my master  got religion,  and new laws were made on the plantation. Formerly we had the privilege of hunting, fishing, making splint brooms, baskets,  c., on Sunday; but this was all stopped. Every Sunday we were all compelled  to attend meeting. Master was so religious that he induced some others to join him in hiring preacher to preach to the slaves.      
     had reached my twelfth year, that if I was spared to become a man, I would try to be as good as my parents. My father could read a little, and make figures, but could scarcely write at all. His custom, on those Sabbaths when we remained at home, was to spend his time in instructing his children, or the neighboring servants, out of a New Testament, sent him from Fredericksburg by one of his older sons. I fancy I can see him now, sitting under his bush arbor, reading that precious book to many attentive hearers around him.             Such was the esteem I had for my pious father, that I have kept that blessed book ever since his death, for his sake; and it was the first New Testament I read, after I felt the pardoning love of God in my soul.             My father died, August 20, 1826, aged 60 years. My mother, Jane Davis, at the death of my father, removed from the farm, where my father died, and spent the remainder of her days in Fredericksburg, with her children. She lived to good old age, and fell asleep in Jesus, Dec. 24, 1831.             My father had been allowed to keep a cow and horse, for his own use; and to raise and feed his hogs and poultry from the mill.--     
       MEMOIR,  C.            In the following Narrative of  OLD ELIZABETH,  which was taken mainly from her own lips in her 97th year, her  simple language has been adhered to as strictly as was  consistent with perspicuity and propriety.             I was born in Maryland in the year 1766. My  parents were slaves. Both my father and mother were  religious people, and belonged to the Methodist  Society. It was my father's practice to read in the  Bible aloud to his children every sabbath morning.  At these seasons, when I was but five years old, I often  felt the overshadowing of the Lord's Spirit, without  at all understanding what it meant; and these incomes and influences continued to attend me until  I was eleven years old, particularly when I was alone,  by which I was preserved from doing anything that  I thought was wrong.             In the eleventh year of my age, my master sent  me to another farm, several miles from my parents,  brothers, and sisters, which was a great trouble to  me. At last I grew so lonely and sad I thought I  should die, if I did not see my mother. I asked the     
   of Petersburg for some one remembering  Cyrus Branch,  met at length an elderly colored couple at work in a field, who said they belonged to the Guildfield Baptist church. John had told him that he was formerly a member of this church, and Mr. P. deemed it his best course to send a note to its pastor by their hands.           On the following Sabbath, towards the close of the services in the Guildfield church, Rev. Mr. Williams, the pastor, said: I have information concerning one Cyrus Branch, formerly a member of this church--his name being on the records. He was at that time a slave. Escaping from his master, after a while he made his way to the Northern States, nearly thirty years since. Is there any one present who owns relationship to him, or can give any account of the family he left behind?           As he ceased to speak there was a profound silence in the congregation of three hundred or four hundred devout worshippers. The elderly people were gathering up their recollections of the past, which included thirty years,  dimned  as they were by privation, affliction and various sorrows. One looked at another, when there arose a woman in the prime of life, who answered audibly but tenderly,  Cyrus Branch was my father. He went away from us when I was five years old, as my mother told me, and we have not heard of him since.   What is your age now, Mrs. Smith?  inquired the good man.  I am thirty-seven years old,  she replied.  Many here knew my mother, who died last summer.   Praised be the Lord,  exclaimed the feeling pastor,  who delivered him from bondage, and has now released him from all fear of being returned to it again, so that he dares to send us word about himself, and look for the kindred of his earlier years.  To which was responded a hearty  Amen.      
     sisters in play. I felt very ill after it, and thought if I feigned to be dead, she would get a whipping. I began to groan out. The women in the spinning-room ran out, thinking I was dying. My mistress's sister, and two young lady visitors, ran into the room; and, feeling I was cold, and noticing that I breathed but slowly--which I was managing, as well as I could, taking a good gasp every time--they turned me over. They also were afraid that I was dying. They began to cry, which brought my mistress into the kitchen. She began to cry, at first; and then, looking  stedfastly  at me,  Stand by,  she said, taking out a pin, unseen by me, she thrust it right into me. I struck out with my feet, and sent a black woman, who had been rubbing me, sprawling on the ground. I holloed out,  Oh! oh! oh!  until they could hear me a mile off. Some ran away instantly, from fear; others burst into loud fits of laughter; my mistress joining in the laugh.  Well,  she said,  I never saw such an artful nigger in all my life. He is always up to of his tricks.             I had a tolerably good time of it now, being in the kitchen, helping to cook, or waiting at the table, listening eagerly to any conversation going on; and thus learning many things, of which the field-hands were totally ignorant.        Sunday at Chapel.             On Sundays we were sent to chapel; all the         slaves being seated in the galleries, apart from the white people.            Mr. Pain, the minister, was absent from chapel, one Sabbath; but, appearing next Sunday, he explained his absence, by informing his congregation that two of his slaves had run away. Immediately, there was a general lamentation, because brother Pain had lost his slaves; and many calculations were made about their value. The following Sunday, the minister, with a face radiant with joy, announced to his audience, that his slaves had been brought back to him. On hearing this, a hubbub of delight pervaded the chapel; but, when he further informed them, that he had administered to each eighty lashes, in order to teach them their duty, and to deter them and others from running away in future, the audience were overjoyed; one saying to another,  Brother Pain has done perfectly right. He has taught them, and all the slaves who hear, what their duty is, and how they are to be dealt with, if they attempt to run away.               When first I came to England, I was surprised to find every clergyman and Dissenting minister, to a man, denouncing slavery, as contrary to Christianity. But the reverse is the case in the Southern States of America. All the Methodists, Baptists, and Independents--in fact, every minister of religion--uphold slavery, and defend it by passages from the very same Book out of which the clergy, in this country, make quotations to condemn it.      
  by the name of Mary Burnepp, of Vermont, in all there  were sixteen. I fell, fortunately, the department taught  by Miss Ella Roper, and Miss Mary Burnepp, and Kate Freeman, and many other too tedious to mention now.                Early in the spring of 1864, April, I entered the school,  with Miss Roper as my teacher, where my progress was so  rapid, I ascended to the head of the first class in school,  and no scholar in school or on the Island could compete  with me, in consequence of which I was made assistant  teacher. When I began to write, I learned to make my  alphabet in one night. The first copy book I ever had I  wrote it up the first night - every page. My teacher set me  no more alphabet, and the first copy of writing was this -     Improve each shining hour.            By reason of study, my health grew bad, and my eyesight  failed me. I made a profession of religion in September,  1864. Before I repented of my sins, I was elected superintendent  of the Sabbath School. Some time in May, the same  year, Rev. Andrew Cartwright lectured the Sabbath school  on the subject of Repentance. I was then honored to the  position in the Sabbath school as Superintendent, but had  not made any profession of faith in Christ, and the language  falling from the mouth of God's servant, touched my heart.  He was followed by my father, and all that each said seemed  to rest on me. By their words used relative to teachers  teaching what they really knew nothing of; then in strong  terms showed that all my instruction given as Superintendent,  would prove to me, without repentance, my eternal  destruction. Then I was convicted, and from that time,  until I manifested a hope, I could not, nor did not, open  school any more. And at a revival in September, 4th Sunday,  about eight o'clock, P. M., I received the Pearl of Great  Price. Soon after, I was nominated and elected Secretary  of church and Board of Trustees.          All the teachers and scholars and members of the church  apparently appreciated me for my usefulness in church,     
      praises of this aged pilgrim who seemed to welcome each coming morning as bringing him nearer home.             He uniformly rose early, but especially early on the Sabbath. When we asked him why he did so he said:  De Lord get up early  dat day . De women dat went to de  sepulcre  got dere early, and den de Lord was not dere. De earlier I gets up de more I sees ob Jesus.              By reason of his infirmities he could not attend upon the services of the sanctuary, but said he:  I  puts up  for you ebery day; I always pray den for all dat blows de gospel trumpet.              Nothing rejoiced him more than to hear that sinners were inquiring the way to the Saviour. Such tidings would make him weep for joy. Once, lifting his hands, he cried:  O Lord, call dem in. Ho Lord! Make dem willing in de day of dy power.              Once, in illustrating that sinners should be more in earnest, he said:  Many tink dey be seeking and seeking 'ligion, and dey be jus putting it off all de time; dey must  lay right down to it ,  jus as de hos would to de dray, or dey neber can get free. You     
     value of his services there, it has been remarked,  no one but a dealer in tobacco can form an idea. Notwithstanding the hundreds of hogsheads that were committed to his charge, he could produce any one the instant it was called for; and the shipments were made with a promptness and correctness, such as no person, white or black, has equalled in the same situation.   *        * It is said, that while employed at the warehouse, he often devoted his leisure time to reading, and that a gentleman, on one occasion, taking up a book which he had left for a few moments, found it to be  Smith's Wealth of Nations.              As early as the year 1815, he began to feel a special interest in the cause of African Missions, and contributed probably more than any other person, in giving origin and character to the African Missionary Society established during that year in Richmond, and which has, for many years, collected and appropriated annually, to the cause of Christianity in Africa, from one hundred, to one hundred and fifty dollars. His benevolence was practical; and whenever and wherever good objects were to be effected, he was ready to lend his aid. He became a preacher several years before he left this country, and generally engaged in this service every Sabbath, among the colored people on plantations a few miles from Richmond.             A correspondent, from whom we have already quoted, observes,  In preaching, notwithstanding his grammatical inaccuracies, he was often truly eloquent. He had derived almost nothing from the schools, and his manner was of course unpolished, but his ideas would sometimes burst upon you in their native solemnity, and awaken deeper feelings than the most polished, but less original and inartificial discourse.  A distinguished Minister of the Presbyterian Church, said to the writer,  A sermon which I heard from Mr. Cary, shortly before he sailed for Africa, was the best extemporaneous sermon I ever heard. It contained more original and impressive thoughts, some of which are distinct in my memory, and never can be forgotten.              Mr. Cary was among the earliest emigrants to Africa. For some time before his departure he had sustained the office of Pastor of a Baptist Church of colored persons in Richmond, embracing nearly eight hundred members, received from it a liberal support, and enjoyed its confidence and affection.-- When an intelligent Minister of the same Church inquired, why he could determine to quit a station of so much comfort and usefulness, to encounter the dangers of an African climate, and hazard every thing to plant a Colony on a distant heathen shore? His reply was to this effect,  I am an African, and in in this country, however meritorious my conduct, and respectable my character, I cannot receive the credit due to either. I wish to go to a country where I shall be estimated by my merits, not by my complexion; and I feel bound to labor for my suffering race.  He seemed to have imbibed the sentiment of Paul, and to have great heaviness and continual sorrow in his heart, for his brethren, his kinsmen according to the flesh.         
   could stammer over the dim and promiscuous syllables in my old black and tattered spelling book, sometimes a piece of one, and then of another; nor would I scarcely spare the time  to return to my ordinary meals, being so truly engaged with my book. And by close application  to my book at night, my visage became  considerally emaciated by extreme perspiration,  having no lucubratory aparatus, no candle,  no lamp, nor even light-wood, being chiefly raised in oaky woods. Hence I had  to sit sweating and smoking over my incompetent  bark or brush light, almost exhausted  by the heat of the fire, and almost suffocated  with smoke; consequently from Monday  morning I anticipated with joy the approach  of the next Sabbath, that I might again retire  to the pleasant umbrage of the woods, whither  I was used to dwell or spend the most of  the day with ceaseless investigation over my  book. A number strove to dissuade me from  my plan, and had the presumption to tell  me that I was a vain fool to attempt learning  to read with as little chance as I had. Playboys  importunately insisted on my abandoning  my foolish theory, and go with them on  streams, desport, and sacrifice the day in athletic  folly, or alibatic levity. Nevertheless        did I persevere with an indefatigable resolution,  at the risk of success. But ah! the oppositions  with which I contended are too tedious  to relate, but not too formidable to surmount;  and I verily believe that those obstacles  had an auspicious tendency to waft me,  as on pacific gales, above the storms of envy  and the calumniating scourge of emulation,  from which literary imagination often sinks  beneath its dignity, and instruction languishes  at the shrine of vanity. I reached the threatening  heights of literature, and braved in a  manner the clouds of disgust which reared in  thunders under my feet. This brings to mind  the verse of an author on the adventurous seaman.              The wandering sailor ploughs the main,           A competence in life to gain;           The threatening waves around him foam,           'Till flattering fancy wafts him home.                 For the overthrow and  downfal of my scheme had been repeatedly threatened. But with  defiance I accomplished the arduous task of  spelling (for thus it was with me,) having no  facilitating assistance. From this I entered into reading lessons with triumph. I became very fond of reading parts of the New Testament,         such as  I  could pick up as they lay  about at random; but I soon became more fond of reading verses, Wesley's old hymns, and other peices of poetry from various authors.  I became found of it to that degree,  that whenever I chanced to light on a piece of paper, so common to be lying about, I would pick it up in order to examine it whether it  was written in that curious style or not. If  it was not, unless some remarkable prose, I  threw it aside; and if it was, I as carefully preserved  it as I would a piece of money. At  length I began to wonder whether it was possible  that I ever could be so fortunate as to  compose in that manner. I fell to work in  my head, and composed several undigested  pieces, which I retained in my mind, for I knew nothing about writing with a pen, also  without the least grammatical knowledge, a  few lines of which I yet retain.  I will give  you the following specimen. On one very  calm Sabbath morning, a while before the  time of preaching, I undertook to compose a  divine hymn, being under some serious impression  of mind:              Rise up, my soul and let us go           Up to the gospel feast;     
   also will thereby furnish your friends with strong arguments and inducements to endeavour the relief of the rest of our  brethern,  as yet in thraldom.           I have been longer on this head then I at first intended, but it being my wish to give it a full and ample discussion, I have been the more  lenthy  in speaking of it, and having I believe got fairly through it, I shall proceed to the next head that I mean to speak to you of And that is Religion, and on this head too I fear I shall be tedious as I wish to give it a fair discussion.           I most earnestly recommend to you a serious, and regular attendance on divine worship every Sabbath day at least, and as often at other times as you conveniently can. Religion being the basis of virtue and morality, when there is a want of Religion we may thence justly infer a want of both. For religion being the best practical system of virtue and good actions consonant to the will of our heavenly father, that is known, it  sooths  and comforts the mind of the afflicted and troubled, alleviates all our distresses, and disposes us to a perfect obedience to the divine will; and good will and peace to all mankind. But in speaking of practical religion, I do not mean that religion that springs from fear, but I mean a religion founded on a love of virtue and a detestation of vice; on a sense of that obedience which is due to the will of the Supreme Being, and a sense of those obligations which creatures formed to live in a mutual state of dependence on one another lie under. I always took the two greatest principles religion to be,  love honour and acknowledge three persons under the one God head, namely the Father Son, and Holy Spirit, three persons and but one God,  and that God I love  adore with my     
     read.  And on the Sabbath there was one sermon preached expressly for the colored people which it was generally my privilege to hear.  I became quite familiar with the texts,  Servants be obedient to your masters. -- Not with eye service as men pleasers. -- He that knoweth his master's will and doeth it not, shall be beaten with many stripes,  and others of this class: for they formed the basis of most of these public instructions to us.  The first commandment impressed upon our minds was to obey our masters, and the second was like unto it, namely, to do as much work when they or the overseers were not watching us as when they were.  But connected with these instructions there was more or less that was truly excellent; though mixed up with much that would sound strangely in the ears of freedom.  There was one very kind hearted Episcopal minister whom I often used to hear; he was very popular with the colored people.  But after he had preached a sermon to us in which he argued from the Bible that it was the will of heaven from all eternity we should be slaves, and our masters be our owners, most of us left him; for like some of the faint hearted disciples in early times we said,-- This is a hard saying, who can bear it?             My manumission, as I shall call it; that is, the bill of sale conveying me to Mr. Smith, was dated Sept. 9th, 1835. I continued     
      primer, and Sunday morning he commenced learning me my letters. By Monday morning I could say them all. He would give me lessons nights and Sabbath mornings. He said when he used to take his master's children to school, he would carry his book in his hat and get the children to give him a lesson in the interval of the school. He grew up to be a young man, experienced religion, and joined the M. E. church, and was authorized to preach among his colored brethren, free and slave, and was set free some time before he worked for my father.             After he left our house I was without a teacher, and there was an old man about seventy-five or eighty years old, a slaveholder, owned a small farm and one slave woman married to a slave belonging to another slaveholder. This woman was the mother of two small children. Her old master had five daughters, one son eighteen years of age, a family of ten     
       THE HOURS FOR WORK.              The slave goes to his work when he sees the daybreak in the morning, and works until dark at night. The slaves have their food carried to them in the field; they have one half hour to eat it in, in the winter, and one hour in the summer. Their time for eating is about eight in the morning, and one in the afternoon. Sometimes, they have not so much time given to them. The overseer stands by them until they have eaten, and then he orders them to work.             The slaves return to their huts at night, make their little fires, and lie down until they are awakened for another day of toil. No beds are given them to sleep on; if they have any, they find themselves. The women and the men all have to work on the farms together; they must fare alike in slavery. Husbands and wives must see all that happens to each other, and witness the sufferings of each. They must see their children polluted, without the power to prevent it.       HOW THE SLAVES CONTRIVE TO GET FOOD.              THERE are some animals in Virginia called raccoons, possums, old hares, and squirrels. The best of these is the possum, which lives in old trees and in the earth. The slave sets his traps in the swamps, where the possum usually lives. The traps are made by cutting down trees, and cutting them in short pieces about five feet long; then they raise the log on three pieces of sticks, like the figure four. These traps are made on the Sabbath. One slave will sometimes have fifteen or twenty of them, and will go at night, with his torch of pitch-pine, and see if his traps have caught anything for him to eat. Sometimes he finds a possum and a raccoon;         and sometimes a squirrel and old hare. This old hare is something like a rabbit. All of these little animals are good food for the poor slave, and make him feel very glad that he has them to eat. Some of the slaves hunt these animals with dogs, trained for the purpose. They run them up the trees in the forest, where, as they are a harmless animal, they can be taken very easily. They do not fight very hard when caught, but are very easily overcome; but they are a very deceitful little animal. They will lie on the ground, and make you think they are dead; but if you leave them, they will creep off so soon, that you cannot conceive how the little animal got away so cute. The only way they can be kept safely is to be put in a bag, or in a basket with a cover. The slave knows best when to hunt these creatures. The best time is just at the rise of the tide in the rivers. There is another method that the slave takes to get his food. He makes what is called a fish-trap. This is made by cutting white oak wood into very small strips, which are tied together with a great deal of ingenuity. This trap is put in very deep water, and attended by the slaves at night, and on the Sabbath, (this being all the time they have to attend to their traps;) and very glad are they of this opportunity of getting some nice fish. Oftentimes the overseer will take what he wants for his own use, and the slaves must submit.             There are some little fruits in Virginia, that are called  simmons ; they grow very plentifully, and are sweet and good. The slaves get them in the fall of the year, then they get a barrel and put the  simmons  into it, and put water there too, and something else that grow on trees, that they call  locusses,  which are about ten inches long, and two across. They put the  locusses  and  simmons  into the water together, and let them stand for two or three days. Then the water is drained off, and the leaves are used as     
      prayer for colleges. At this concert, in the year 1834, a six o'clock morning prayer-meeting was appointed. When the pastor came, he found that Phebe had been there,  on the door steps more than an hour praying!  While it was yet dark, she found her way to the  prayer-meeting, as Mary to the sepulchre. Who can tell how many souls were converted in answer to the prayers on that door-step--how much they had to do with those conversions  in college which occurred at this time, and the fruits of which may be seen in the ministers scattered abroad, preaching the gospel, gathering souls into the kingdom of Christ? Those  seasons of revivals in college, have they no connection with the prayers of this humble saint, who lived to pray: lived in obscurity, and yet lived for the college; lived for the  church; lived for the pastor; lived for the world?             Phebe  loved the church and female prayer-meeting.  Through the storm and wind and bad walking, she would find her way to the place of prayer. In the female prayer-meeting, all  loved to kneel when Phebe prayed. She approached the throne of grace as if her mind and heart were already there, and she had only to open her lips and the prayer of the heart  ascended, in humility and faith and love. The last Sabbath she spent on earth she was at church as usual, and stopped at noon, and was conversing on the value and importance of  this meeting. She then alluded to a time, about four years since, when  she could not hold her peace.  About this time Phebe seemed more fully than ever before to receive Christ as  an all-sufficient, present Saviour. The blessings of His salvation seemed as much her own, as if she alone was heir to the redemption purchased by Christ. She  knew in whom she  believed,  and that  He was able to make all grace abound toward her.  Grace was triumphant in her soul, and so continued, by her own testimony given at her last interview  with her Christian friends. From this time, as she often expressed it,  she had never let her Saviour go;   she had held Him by the hand,  nay more,  He had come into her heart, and continued             to abide with her.   Satan is busy with me,  she would sometimes say,  but my Lord is  stronger than he.   My little house,  said she,  this winter has become a  palace : while  sweeping my room to-day, I thought, I must sweep softly, for He was here, my Lord and  King.              Phebe  was humble.  Her humility drew all hearts towards her. All the attention she received did not cause her for a moment to step aside from her own humble path, in which she  continued to walk, doing her own work, or rather the Lord's, in her own humble, quiet way. She rarely, if ever, spoke first, yet was always ready to respond heartily to the greetings of  her brethren and sisters in Christ. She literally and truly sought out the  lowest seat . Down by the door at the evening meeting sat Phebe, with her head bowed, neither seeing nor  wishing to be seen. Being urged to come up nearer, as she had often been before, it was said to her,  What will you do, Phebe, when you got to heaven?   My Master will tell me where to sit,  she answered. There was a peculiar lowly attitude of spirit and manner which sat on her with a natural grace and beauty, that cannot be described.             Phebe  had no fear of death.  She died as suddenly as her mistress, and now lies by her side in the Pinegrove cemetery, where lie so many of the loved and honoured. She had often  expressed a desire to be placed at her mistress' feet. As she was expecting to die  suddenly  and  alone , she had given the signal to her nearest neighbour, that when she saw no smoke  from her chimney in the morning, she would know that she was gone.  When you hear I am gone home,  said she to the writer of this, the Sabbath before she died,  praise the  Lord.   I shall go soon, very soon. If to-morrow you hear I am gone home to heaven, rejoice and give thanks, and remember, it is well with me.   Jesus, lover of my soul,  she repeated at this, our last Sabbath interview;  yes,  lover,  LOVER, LOVER! How can I better express  it? ' Jesus, lover of my soul. '               A few hours only before she was called away, she came to look on the wife of her pastor, then sleeping      
      such time as the driver thought proper, when he would crack his whip two or three times, and they would eat their breakfasts, which consisted of strong, rancid pork, coarse corn bread, and water, which was brought to them by small children, who were not able to handle the hoe. As soon as Harry, the driver, has finished his breakfast, they finish likewise, and hang up their buckets on the fence or trees, and to work they go, without one moment's intermission until noon, when they take their dinner in the same manner as their breakfast; which done, they go again to work, continuing till dark. They then return to their cabins, and have a half hour to prepare their food for the next day, when the horn is again blown for bed. If any are found out of their cabins after this time, they are put in jail and kept till morning, when they  generally receive twenty-five or thirty lashes for their  misdemeanor. So it continues through the week until  Sunday, when the women take their tubs and blankets and start for the brooks, where they dismantle and robe themselves in their blanket, wash and dry their clothes, put them on again, and are ready to be at the house at four o'clock to receive their weekly allowance, which is weighed out to them by the overseer. The men give their shirts to the women to wash, and take their baskets or hoes and start for the field. The are generally paid for this extra work; if they do not work, they are set  down as lazy persons, and are whipped because they will not work for themselves. Thus is the Sabbath passed. That day of rest and prayer is as other days to the poor slave. For six years whilst I was on this farm, there was never such a thing as a slave going to meeting, or  hearing the word of God in any form.      
      never laid her weary head upon her pillow  without thinking of her mother, and her  husband, and her children, and praying God to  bless them wherever they were, and to unite  them to her in the  New Jerusalem.  In  this world she never thought again to see them.            Sally grieved most for the pleasant Fayetteville  Sundays, when, with her family about  her, she had gone to church and heard the  Bible read, and the singing, and the sermon. Sunday on an Alabama plantation was a very  different thing. All the servants who worked  at a distance came home on that day to see  their wives and families. Tired out with the  labor of the week, it was, notwithstanding, the only time they had in which to do any  thing for themselves. They were required to  keep their clothes clean, and this was the only  day on which they could wash them. Then  those who had a patch of ground given them  to cultivate, wanted this time to work upon it.  Some took the opportunity to go fishing, keeping  part of the fish they caught as a treat for  themselves, and selling the rest to their  mistress to obtain a little money for buying flour  or molasses. But most of them were too tired           to work, and would throw themselves down  anywhere upon the ground, and sleep through  the day like so many dogs, Bred to nothing  but physical exercise--having only their  animal nature cultivated, and constantly  over-tasked, what else could be expected? When  they finished their work early enough on  Saturday evenings, they sometimes had a  prayer-meeting in a grove at a little distance  from the house. Sally could not attend this,  nor the meeting on Sunday morning,  But  gen'ally,  said she,  I could get about   half an hour to go down to de afternoon meetin',  when de folks was at dinner. We didn't  have any preacher dere who knew how to  read, our deacon couldn't read a word, but  'peared like he allers know what to say. I  know he talked right well, for I used to notice  when I went to de church, an' 'peared like he  talked just as de minister did. Den, after he'd  exhorted, I'd have to go away, so they'd sing  some far'well hymns, and den I'd go back to  de house. Dis yer was one of de hymns I  loved to sing:      'I'll have a place in Paradise           				      'The blessed hour, it soon will come,                   Sally had joined the Baptist church soon  after she was purchased by Mr. Cone, but she  was never allowed to attend the services  except on Sacrament Sundays, when her master  insisted that this privilege should be granted  her. The church was several miles away,  and she had to make such haste in going and  coming, on account of the dinner, that these  were to her the most tiresome days of the year.            Sabbath afternoon was the favorite time for  training dogs to hunt negroes. When not in  use, the dogs were always kept chained, and  no colored person was allowed to speak to them, or to feed them, under the penalty of  a severe whipping. At training times, the  dogs were let loose, and put on the track of a           little negro boy, who was made to climb a  tree. When they could trace him unerringly  to his place of concealment, they were  considered trained.            Such sights as this greeted Sally on the  Sabbath. Every evening in the week there  were family prayers at the house, which were  free to all the servants. Sally longed to listen  to the Bible, and she always went, excepting  when her mistress had treated her so harshly  that she thought to hear her read would do  her more harm than good. Thus, with very  little change, year after year passed away.  Mr. Cone's sons were growing up about him,  one of them, Stanley, into an idle, dissolute  young man. Sally had heard nothing from her children, but she continued to show to Charlotte Rives, now married to the coachman, the kindness and care of a mother.             I had heaps 'o trouble, den,  said Sally,  I  didn't 'spect to got rid of it; I didn't look  forward to nothin; but  I jes picked up de cross  an' put it in my bosom , for de sake of de dear  Lord who carried it for me so long ago!        
   and drink, and do judgment and justice, and then was it well with him? He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well with him: was not this to know me? saith the Lord. But thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy covetousness, and for to shed innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it.           Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah. They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah lord! or Ah his glory! Jeremiah 22d chap. 13 to 15.           Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you. Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver is cankered, and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire,--ye have heaped treasures together for the last days. Behold, the hire of the laborers who have reapt down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth. And the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of  Sabaoth.  Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton, ye have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter. Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you. Be patient, therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. James 5th chap. 1st to 7th verses.               That's the way it is with the Christian, when his warfare is ended here below. Here is a short sentence of the wayfaring Aaron.            When Aaron was in Hallowell in the State of Maine, a gentleman told him there were 52 strong anti-slavery families lived in H., but he could not get a soul good enough to take him in. He thinks if it had been winter he should have frozen to death, but providentially it was warm weather. He laid himself down upon a harrow, but the little red and black ants troubled him so he was obliged to seek shelter some where else. He tarried the rest of the night in a privy. When he arose he found a beautiful morning: he walked four miles, then asked a gentleman if he would give him some breakfast; he told him he was drunk and foolish, and ought to go to the Asylum. He proceeded to two houses farther and there the Lord opened their hearts. They provided him with a good breakfast, which refreshed him much, and they gave him food     
                       But we do expect to meet our dear sister on earth yet .  We expect every day to hear some one come and say,  your  sister is coming.  That will be joyful news to hear. But God knows what is best, and we are willing to wait on him, and if it is his will for us to see our dear sister we will see her. If not, we will not until the day of final consummation. There we will meet to part no more.-- When we parted, she said to me,  good bye, my dear brother, if I do not see you any more I hope to meet you in heaven.  How many tears I have shed since that day to see my sister. I would give  anything in this world to see her once more on earth. I hope and trust the day has passed away that father and mother,  sister and brother, and children will be parted until God himself parts them. Then we can feel better satisfied when our Heavenly Master does it. But now we can sing these songs of joy to  ourselves.              NOW A SONG OF JOY.               Bright hopes are coming now. The war commenced. I was the house  servant, but was taken into the army for some months. You know what army       
     But, I tell you, I believe there is only two places for us--heaven and torment. If we miss heaven we must be forever lost.               Yes, Aunt Charlotte, that's the teaching of the Bible.               Aunt Jane used to tell us, too, that the children of Israel was in Egypt in bondage, and that God delivered them out of Egypt; and she said he would deliver us. We all used to sing a hymn like this:        'My God delivered Daniel, Daniel, Daniel;            O, you ought to hear Richard sing that hymn! I never can forget Aunt Jane, for when old marster used to be so hard on me it seemed I'd have to give up sometimes and die. But then the Spirit of God would come to me and fill my heart with joy. It seemed the more trials I had the more I could pray.               Aunt Charlotte, you remind me of Pilgrim's Progress.               Yes, I remember about Pilgrim traveling          from the City of Destruction to the Celestial City.              I said,  His name was John Bunyan. He was confined in jail twelve years on account of his religion.               Was he a slave too?               No; he was not a slave, but at the time he lived people were persecuted on account of their religious belief.               Yes, my child, that's the way it is here in Louisiana. The most of the white people were Catholics around where I lived, and we poor darkies that did not believe in Catholic religion had to suffer on account of it. But that's the time a true child of God prays, when he gets in trouble. For I know the most peaceful hours were when marster would put me in jail all day Sunday. We used to sing this song:        'O, brother, where was you?                  Yes, my dear child, that hymn filled me with joy many a time when I'd be in prison on Sunday. I'd sit all day singing and praying. I tell you, Jesus did come and bless me in there. I was sorry for marster. I wanted to tell him sometimes about how sweet Jesus was to my soul; but he did not care for nothing in this world but getting rich. He had a brother living in Georgia. I believe he did not believe in Catholic religion.              We all knowed his brother from Georgia, because he used to always come out in rolling season to see us make sugar. He used to love to hear us sing. Once while he was out he took mighty sick, and I had to attend to him. He asked me to pray for him. I said, 'Yes, sir; I will pray for you, but you must touch the hem of the Saviour's garment yourself.' 'Yes,' he said, 'I am a Christian, and have been for many years.' We used to hear him sing, when he was riding over the field looking at the cane, one hymn he used to like. It was this:        'When my heart first believed,                           What a joy I received,                           What a heaven in Jesus's name!'     
               In all these slave songs there was ever some expression of praise of the Great House farm--something that would please the pride of the Lloyds.              These words would be sung over and over again, with others, improvised as they went along--jargon, perhaps, to the reader, but full of meaning to the singers. I have sometimes thought that the mere hearing of these songs would have done more to impress the good people of the north with the soul-crushing  character of slavery than whole volumes exposing the physical cruelties of the slave system; for the heart has no language like song. Many years ago, when recollecting my experience in this respect, I wrote of these slave songs in the following strain:              I did not, when a slave, fully understand the deep meaning  of those rude and apparently incoherent songs. I was, myself, within the circle, so that I could then neither hear nor see as those without might see and hear. They breathed the prayer and complaint of souls overflowing with the  bitterest anguish. They depressed my spirits and filled my heart with ineffable sadness.              The remark in the olden time was not unfrequently made, that slaves were the most contented and happy laborers in the world, and their dancing and singing were referred to in proof of this alleged fact; but it was a great mistake to suppose them happy because they sometimes made those joyful noises. The songs of the slaves represented their sorrows, rather than their joys. Like tears, they were a relief to aching hearts. It is not inconsistent with the constitution of the human mind, that avails itself of one and the same method for expressing opposite emotions. Sorrow and desolation have their songs, as well as joy, and peace.             It was the boast of slaveholders that their slaves enjoyed     
        ANTI-SLAVERY SONG.                                  Woman too for justice knocks,                           At your door beseechingly.                              Shall their tears to pity move,                           Tears observed by God above,                           God, whose Justice, truth, and love                           Never sides with tyranny.                              Blush Americans for shame,                           There's a blot upon your fame:                           Wipe it out, and get a name                           For justice, truth, and equity.                              Then the Union all around                           Songs of jubilee will sound,                           And a State no more be found                           Stained with Human Slavery.

   up to a region where the great storm which we call a  hurricane had torn up the pine trees by the roots.  On  one of these trees there was a large head, which frightened  me; it had large dreadful-looking eyes, which turned as  I walked on.  I afterwards discovered this to be an owl,  not able to fly; but the head was quite as large as a full-  grown owl's.  I succeeded in killing this, but not until I  had a sharp fight with the old ones, who were overhead,  and who followed me quite half a mile, knowing I  had taken their young one.  The slaveholders live upon  their slaves just as the hawk and owl live upon the hen  and chicken.          The Methodists and Independents hold slaves, as also  do the Baptists.    CHAPTER VII.   THE NEGRO SONGS.            I fear that this  chapter will prove to many rather uninteresting;  but at the same time, there are many who, I am  quite sure, would wish to know what  are  the songs with  which the negroes beguile their leisure hours.  The following  is one of them, and a great favourite among the  negroes.   A SPIRITUAL HYMN.                               O Shepherd, wha' thou bin all day,                             O Shepherd, wha' thou bin all day,                             O Shepherd, wha' thou bin all day,                             You promised my Jesus to mind these lambs,                             And he pays you at the coming day.                             O children, he pays you at the coming day,                              O children, he pays you at the coming day,                             O children, he pays you at the coming day.                               O Shepherd, the lambs all gone astray,                             O Shepherd, the lambs all gone astray,                             O Shepherd, the lambs all gone astray,                             You promised my Jesus to mind these lambs,                             And he pays you at the coming day.                             O children, he pays you at the coming day,                             O children, he pays you at the coming day,                             O children, he pays you at the coming day.                               Did you ever see such a carriage roll,                             Did you ever see such a carriage roll,                             Did you ever see such a carriage roll,                             And it rolls like judgment day.                             O children, it rolls like judgment day,                             O children, it rolls like judgment day,                             O children, it rolls like judgment day.                                   The fore-wheel roll by the grace of God,                             The fore-wheel roll by the grace of God,                             The fore-wheel roll by the grace of God,                             And the hind-wheel roll by faith.                             O children, the hind-wheel roll by faith,                             O children, the hind-wheel roll by faith,                             O children, the hind-wheel roll by faith.                               It roll for me and it roll for you,                             It roll for me and it roll for you,                             It roll for me and it roll for you,                             And it roll for the whole world round.                             O children, it roll for the whole world round,                             O children, it roll for the whole world round,                             O children, it roll for the whole world round.                               Did you ever hear such a trumpet ring,                             Did you ever hear such a trumpet ring,                             Did you ever hear such a trumpet ring,                             All it ring like judgment day.                             O children, it ring like judgment day,                             O children, it ring like judgment day,                             O children, it ring like judgment day,                               It ring for me and it roll for you,                             It ring for me and it roll for you,                             It ring for me and it roll for you,                             And it ring for the whole world round.                             O children, it ring for the whole world round,                             O children, it ring for the whole world round,                              O children, it ring for the whole world round.                              My Jesus he put on the long white robe,                              My Jesus he put on the long white robe,                             My Jesus he put on the long white robe,                             And he sail thro' Galilee                             O children, he sail thro' Galilee,                             O children, he sail thro' Galilee,                             O children, he sail thro' Galilee                               He sail for me and he sail for you,                             He sail for me and he sail for you,                             He sail for me and he sail for you,                             And he sail for the whole world round.                             O children, he sail for the whole world round,                             O children, he sail for the whole world round,                             O children, he sail for the whole world round.            This hymn is a great  favourite with the slaves, and is sung by them while they clap their hands to keep time.   Probably the reason for the number of repeats, is because  they have no books allowed them; and indeed, they cannot  read, and therefore, on hearing a single line sung by the  white people, these poor slaves cannot prize it too much,  as is shown by their singing it over and over.                The following is a favourite hymn of the poor negroes in the dusk of eventide, or on the dark night, after work:                                 We shall hear the trumpet sounding                             'Fore the break of day,                             We'll take the wings of th' morning,                             And fly away to my Canaan land,                             Bright angels shall come to bear my soul                             To my rosen,  rosen  Lamb.      rosen, probably a corruption of risen.                This hymn was often to  me a sweet solace after a hard  day's work under the horrible tyranny of slavery.  It  used to refresh us to think that heaven was so near, and  that soon we should be there.          The following is perhaps, not quite so intelligible as the  previous one:                                 Oh, me an' my wife we'er hand in hand,                             And all our children in one band                              They honour the Lamb.                             Oh, silver slippers on my feet,                             We'll slip and slide thro' paradise,                             And honour the Lamb.           It must be remembered that these hymns are composed  of fragments of hymns, which we had heard sung at the  meeting-houses and camp-meetings of the white men.   Under these circumstances, it is indeed wonderful that  they are as intelligible as they are.  A few more may, perhaps,  be acceptable to the reader.  This one we used to  sing when in some such spirit as was David of old, when  he indicted that interesting Psalm, beginning  Truly God  is good to Israel.   (lxxiii.)                               Old Satan told me to my face                             He'd drag my kingdom down;                             But Jesus whispered in my ears                             He'd build it up again.                                                               CHORUS.                             Oh, we'll walk and talk 'bout Jesus,                             Glory, hallelujah!                             Oh, we'll walk and talk 'bout Jesus,                             Glory to my soul.             We used to sing this when we had seen the wicked in  high places, and the servants of God suffering injustice.   But when we had sung this we considered the end, and  saw that they were set in slippery places.  Our hymns were all we could get of real spiritual food, and yet they  were blest by God to the conversion of many, and to the         building up of his saints.   Truly out of the mouths of  babes and sucklings hath he perfected praise.           After we had sung one of these songs, we would kneel  down, and one of us would offer prayer, and then we  would spring up and strike up a new song one of joy  and gladness:                                Oh, what a happy day                             When the Christian people meet,                             They shall meet to part no more.                              Tracks I see and I'll pursue                             The narrow way to heaven I view,                             Jesus, my all, to heaven is gone,                             He whom I fix my hopes upon.                               CHORUS.                             Oh, what a happy day,  c.,  c.           It will be seen more  particularly from the foregoing,  that the negroes compose their songs chiefly from snatches  of hymns which they hear sung by the white people,  interpolated, it is true, with now and then a line of the  original.  Judge them not harshly, gentle reader, for their  plagiarism, if such it may be called, for were you in their  position, we doubt if you could do better.          As perhaps these slave songs may be interesting to the  reader, I will give two or three more, with which I will  conclude:                               I want to go where Moses gone, Glory, hallelujah!                             I want to go to the promised land,                             Glory, hallelujah!                             Sweet milk and honey overflows,                             Glory, hallelujah!           These lines would be  repeated with great energy, the  hallelujah being sometimes in the middle of the line, instead  of in its legitimate position; thus:                               I want to go, hallelu', hallelu',                             Where Moses gone, hallelu', hallelu', hallelu'.'          The following may show  our feelings with regard to  death:                               Death, O death, O where are you going?                             Oh hallelu', hallelu', hallelujah!                             I'm coming for some of your souls,                             Oh hallelu', hallelu', hallelujah!          We feared not death,  but would rather welcome it with  songs, for we, ignorant as we are, felt that we should  receive the  Crown of Life.                  It is remarkable to notice that, although the poor  negroes are but very little acquainted with the Sacred  Scriptures, yet the Almighty, apparently to show man the  futility of attempting to keep the mind of his fellow-man  in ignorance of Him, has imparted to the poor despised  one a species of subtlety in acquiring religious knowledge,  which may appear to those who are not personally  acquainted with the fact, extraordinary and impossible.   If God so honour the negro, and if He works for his deliverance  from bondage as He has been doing, ought we to  be idle ? Surely if we stand calmly by, and see our  brother murdered, shall not we be guilty of his blood?   Some have blamed  Abolitionists  for over-zealousness;  but surely no one could be too zealous for the destruction  of a system which works, or can work, as described in  these pages.   Let us be up and doing, for the night  cometh when no man  can  work.                               Oh, early in the morning,                             Early in the evening,                             Then we'll shout glory, glory, in my soul.                               Old fathers, can't you ride and tell?                             Bless the Lord, we'll rise and tell,                             Then we'll shout glory, glory, in my soul.            This the slaves sing  to keep time while picking cotton in  the field under the burning sun; soon after, the whiplash  falls on their backs by their drunken masters and  overseers, till the blood runs down.  And still they say  that the slaves are better off than the working people in  free countries, which is as big a lie as ever was told.          A man by the name of Stevondecause, in South Carolina,  kept a storehouse at the cross road, over the mill branch.   There he sold liquor and other things to the white people  at daytime; he enticed the negroes to steal at night cotton  and corn, and other things, for which he gave them liquor  and one thing or another; and he steals it from them by  not giving them what it is worth, and tells them to go and  steal more, and not let their masters see them.  And when  he got rich enough to buy niggers himself, he stopped  trading with the others.  He went across Black River  Swamp, where he bought  plantation, and was one of the  worst masters that ever lived.  He was afraid to let any of  his niggers leave his plantation at night, and told them if  they did he would whip them; and why, because it takes a  rough to catch a rough, and he is afraid they will steal      
     to meet again, and little children torn from their parents' loving arms, and sold into slavery, and into the hands of strangers from distant parts. Here is a pictorial illustration of the slaves being sold at a public auction--           Slaves being sold at Public Auction.  This cut appeared in the book called  Uncle Tom's Cabin,  and now used by permission of  The Christian Age.       RELIGIOUS AWAKENING.             In the midst of all their sufferings, the slaves would sing many of the religious songs that were sung by Jubilee Singers. And I often joined in the singing, When I resolved to  seek religion,  I was then nearly sixteen years          of age. My master was a member of the Episcopalian Church, and would teach me to say my prayers, and the Apostles' Creed, and read to me about Abraham's servants and Isaac's servants, and Jacob's servants, and  servants, obey your masters.  He would read these  wise  precepts over to me so carefully, have prayers, and then, when he felt like it (which he often did), gave me a lashing. And whenever he thought I ought to have a flogging, he would say to me:  Report yourself to me to-morrow morning after breakfast.  If I did not report to get my flogging, I would have an extra lashing for that. Yet, with all this, my lot was much better than many of those around me. There was a man who owned the next plantation whose name was Jackson. He was so cruel to the slaves that he was known to them as  the devil.  I remember well how I used to think of  seeking religion,  but whenever I began to think seriously on this matter, a great obstacle confronted me. I was superstitious. Superstition is characteristic of the race in Africa. Having been brought to America, not permitted to be taught to read the Bible, and having every avenue to education closed against us, it was natural we should retain the superstitions of our fathers. My idea was that if I set out to  seek religion,  I must meet with that old serpent, the devil. I often heard slaves say that when they set out to  seek religion,  the devil set out with them, and this greatly perplexed me. Then I heard them talk of seeing ghosts. But after they were converted they would go six and ten miles at night to a meeting, and God would be with them. I resolved to set out definitely to get religion, with all my strange thoughts and fears. I thought the worst sin a man could be guilty of was murder. I knew I was innocent of that. One day, I was out gathering blackberries, and commenced to pray the Lord's Prayer; I knew not what else to say. As I prayed, a rabbit jumped up from under the bush from which I was gathering the berries. I felt sure          this was the devil. I had heard that when he deceived Eve in the garden, he came like a serpent; and, furthermore, he could put himself into any shape. I was never more frightened in all my life. I was afraid to say my prayers at night, not so much because I might disturb the devil, but because he might disturb me. I wept bitterly in my loneliness and in my darkness of mind, having no father or mother to direct me.      SOLD TO ANOTHER MASTER.             About the year 1852 my master took to himself a wife, and then I was sold to his brother, who lived in Richmond, Virginia. Here I again met my dear mother, after having been separated from her for about six years. This brother had always been kind to slaves, and every member of the family followed his example. How much he paid for me I never heard. His son once told me that he had been offered three thousand dollars in gold for me, but that he would not accept the amount. From this time I received better treatment. I was never flogged after coming into his hands. I was told that I was to be the property of his eldest son. He was much younger than myself. Now, during all this time I never lost sight of the lessons my dear mother had taught me, and while I was separated from her I worked hard in order to be able to make the letters of the Alphabet, and had learned to spell a large number of words. But I found out that the white people did not use the large letters of the Alphabet as I did when writing. I was strongly of the impression that an education consisted in knowing how to write, and I also knew that the slave-owners were opposed to their slaves acquiring even the most elementary literary knowledge. There was a slave on our lot named Anthony Burnes, who managed to get to Boston. Under the fugitive slave law he was brought back to Richmond, Virginia,     
      about midnight, he commenced an audible prayer, in which be asked God's blessing on his poor father and mother, the missionaries, and the Sunday school, and on his own soul. He frequently, during his sickness, attempted to sing some of the Sunday school hymns, and on the day of his death, he commenced singing the hymn,      There is a fountain filled with blood,       which he had learned from the S. S. Harp, but being unable, from shortness of breath, to accomplish it, Mr. Perkins assisted him, and thus together they sung several verses, Griswold joining in as well as he could. A few hours before his death, Mr. Perkins asked him what he would wish to say to his father. He replied,  Bless the Lord, O my father; honor and worship him forever. Cast away all your idols, and worship him alone.  After this, he seemed to gather up all his remaining strength, and           prayed aloud and distinctly for his parents, all his friends in Africa, teachers and scholars of the mission schools, that God would have mercy on them; he alluded to the justice of God in condemning the wicked, and expressed his thankfulness that God so loved the world as to give his only begotten Son that he might  save them from the worm that dieth not, and the fire that is not quenched.  He then repeated with great solemnity and unusual distinctness--and it was the last sentence he uttered-- The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore. Amen.              This was about ten o'clock at night, and, for an hour after, he occasionally attempted to sing a hymn, but was only able to make out a few notes. During the remaining hour of his life, he was in a dying state, but apparently free from conscious suffering; and just before twelve he quietly slept the sleep of death, and who can doubt that angels stood ready to transport the           soul of our departed brother to the realms of bliss and glory. When we consider how many there are, who, amid the full blaze of gospel light, neglect the care of their souls and a proper preparation for eternity, we cannot but be reminded, by the foregoing narrative, of these words of our Saviour:  I say unto you that many shall come from the east and from the west, and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness.   Unto whom much is given, of them shall much be required.               The following hymn, which was a great favorite with Griswold, was, as already noticed, sung by him on his dying bed:                                  And there may I, though vile as he,                           Wash all my sins away.                               Thou dying Lamb! thy precious blood                           Shall never lose its power,                           Till all the ransomed church of God                           Are saved, to sin no more.                              Since first, by faith, I saw the stream,                           Thy flowing wounds supply,                          Redeeming love has been my theme,                           And shall be, till I die.                              And when this feeble, stammering tongue                           Lies silent in the grave--                           Then, in a nobler, sweeter song,                           I'll sing thy power to save.

      perhaps with a hymn, in which he or she would be followed by all in the room, unless it happened that they did not know the piece, which was perhaps being made up as the singer went along.             Of course there were no musical conductors, but the slaves in part made up for this lack by keeping time with their feet and hands. These meetings would sometimes last all night, and the slaves, ignorant as they were, always enjoyed them.             The following hymn was one of the most popular, and was sure to be sung at these meetings:       Roll Jordan roll, roll Jordan roll,               As I have said before, slaves were very musical in their way, which, if not up to the modern ideas of music, was such that they derived very much enjoyment from it. At nearly all times one would hear the slaves singing snatches of old plantation songs, which for want of space I cannot print, but the following is a part of one of the best known songs:        When I was a little pickanninny, playin' around de cabin door,          
    there to lead miserable lives on the cotton and sugar plantations. Benjamin, my dear brother, left Petersburgh, and I have not seen him since. Thanks be unto God, prayer can ascend, and will be listened to by Him who answereth prayer! To him who crieth unto Him day and night, he will listen, and send His angel of peace to quiet his troubled heart, with the assurance that the down-trodden shall be lifted up, the oppressed shall be delivered from his oppressor, all captives set free, and all oppressors destroyed, as in ancient times. I know that God heard the prayers of my praying mother, because she was a Christian, and a widow, such as feared God and loved his commandments. She used often to sing the following hymn:--       Our days began with trouble here,   Then sow the seed of grace while young,               With the above lines has my mother often soothed, for a time, her own sorrows, when she thought of her poor son, so far away from her, she knew not where, neither could she know of his sufferings; and again, she would become a prey to bitter grief. Her only hope was to meet her son in heaven, where slaveholders could not come with their purchase-money, where Lacy could not come with his dogs, his guns, or his pistols, with powder or balls; neither would she have to steal away to see him, with a little food well concealed. Neither will Benjamin be obliged to crouch in the forest, hearing the midnight cry of wild beasts around him, while he seeks repose upon the cold, bare ground. No, she will meet him at the right hand of the Redeemer, who will wipe the briny tears from the eyes of the poor slave, and feed him with the hidden treasures of His love.              SABBATH AND RELIGIOUS MEETINGS.             AFTER doing their morning work, and breakfast over, (such as it is,) that portion of them belonging to the church ask of the overseer permission to attend meeting. If he is in the mood to grant their request, he writes them a pass, as follows:--               Permit the bearer to pass and repass to--, this evening, unmolested.               Should a pass not be granted, the slave lies down, and sleeps for the day--the only way to drown his sorrow and disappointment.             Others of the slaves, who do not belong to the church, spend their Sabbath in playing with marbles, and other games, for each other's food,  c.            Some occupy the time in dancing to the music of a banjo, made out of a large gourd. This is continued till the after part of the day, when they separate, and gather wood for their log-cabin fires the ensuing week.             Not being allowed to hold meetings on the plantation, the slaves assemble in the swamps, out of reach of the patrols. They have an understanding among themselves as to the time and place of getting together. This is often done by the first one arriving breaking boughs from the trees, and bending them in the direction of the selected spot. Arrangements are then made for conducting the exercises. They first ask each other how they feel, the state of their minds,  c. The male members then select a certain space, in separate groups, for their division of the meeting. Preaching in order, by the brethren; then praying and singing all round, until they generally feel quite happy. The speaker usually commences by calling himself unworthy, and talks very slowly, until, feeling the spirit, he grows excited,         and in a short time, there fall to the ground twenty or thirty men and women under its influence. Enlightened people call it excitement; but I wish the same was felt by everybody, so far as they are sincere.             The slave forgets all his sufferings, except to remind others of the trials during the past week, exclaiming:  Thank God, I shall not live here always!  Then they pass from one to another, shaking hands, and bidding each other farewell, promising, should they meet no more on earth, to strive and meet in heaven, where all is joy, happiness and liberty. As they separate, they sing a parting hymn of praise.             Sometimes the slaves meet in an old log-cabin, when they find it necessary to keep a watch. If discovered, they escape, if possible; but those who are caught often get whipped. Some are willing to be punished thus for Jesus' sake. Most of the songs used in worship are composed by the slaves themselves, and describe. their own sufferings. Thus:--        O, that I had a bosom friend,        How I do wander, up and down;                  Some of the slaves sing--     No more rain, no more snow,       then they change it by singing--   Glory be to God that rules on high.               In some places, if the slaves are caught praying to God, they are whipped more than if they had committed a great crime. The slaveholders will allow the slaves to dance, but do not want them to pray to God. Sometimes, when a     
        Where are you going, Jim?       David the king was grievit and worrit,       -   and many other similar songs, of the meaning of which I had of course no idea, and I have since thought neither he nor his friends could have had any more than I.      
            Finally the war closed, and the day of freedom came. It was a momentous and eventful day to all upon our plantation. We had been expecting it. Freedom was in the air, and had been for months. Deserting soldiers returning to their homes were to be seen every day. Others who had been discharged, or whose regiments had been paroled, were constantly passing near our place. The  grape-vine telegraph  was kept busy night and day. The news and mutterings of great events were swiftly carried from one plantation to another. In the fear of  Yankee  invasions, the silverware and other valuables were taken from the  big house,  buried in the woods, and guarded by trusted slaves. Woe be to any one who would have attempted to disturb the buried treasure. The slaves would give the Yankee soldiers food, drink, clothing  -  anything but that which had been specifically intrusted to their care and honour. As the great day drew nearer, there was more singing in the slave quarters than usual. It was bolder, had more ring, and lasted later into the night. Most of the verses of the plantation songs had some reference to freedom. True, they had sung those same verses before, but they had been careful to explain that the  freedom  in these songs referred to the next world, and had no connection        with life in this world. Now they gradually threw off the mask, and were not afraid to let it be known that the  freedom  in their songs meant freedom of the body in this world. The night before the eventful day, word was sent to the slave quarters to the effect that something unusual was going to take place at the  big house  the next morning.  There was little, if any, sleep that night. All was excitement and expectancy. Early the next morning word was sent to all the slaves, old and young, to gather at the house. In company with my mother, brother, and sister, and a large number of other slaves, I went to the master's house. All of our master's family were either standing or seated on the veranda of the house, where they could see what was to take place and hear what was said. There was a feeling of deep interest, or perhaps sadness, on their faces, but not bitterness. As I now recall the impression they made upon me, they did not at the moment seem to be sad because of the loss of property, but rather because of parting with those whom they had reared and who were in many ways very close to them. The most distinct thing that I now recall in connection with the scene was that some man who seemed to be a stranger (a United States officer, I presume) made a little speech and then read a rather long paper  -       
     your sinful ways, and be faithful servants. Obey your old master and your young master your old mistress and your young mistress. If you disobey your earthly master, you offend your heavenly Master. You must obey God's commandments. When you go from here, don't stop at the corners of the streets to talk, but go directly home, and let your master and mistress see that you have come.            The benediction was pronounced. We went home, highly amused at brother Pike's gospel teaching, and we determined to hear him again. I went the next Sabbath evening, and heard pretty much a repetition of the last discourse. At the close of the meeting, Mr. Pike informed us that he found it very inconvenient to meet at the friend's house, and he should be glad to see us, every Sunday evening, at his own kitchen.           I went home with the feeling that I had heard the Reverend Mr. Pike for the last time. Some of his members repaired to his house, and found that the kitchen sported two tallow candles; the first time, I am sure, since its present occupant owned it, for the servants never had any thing but pine knots. It was so long before the reverend gentleman descended from his comfortable parlor that the slaves left, and went to enjoy a Methodist shout. They never seem so happy as when shouting and singing at religious meetings. Many of them are sincere, and nearer to the gate of heaven than sanctimonious Mr. Pike, and other long-faced Christians, who see wounded Samaritans, and pass by on the other side.           The slaves generally compose their own songs and          hymns, and they do not trouble their heads much about the measure. They often sing the following verses:    Old Satan is one busy ole man;         If I had died when I was young,                 I well remember one occasion when I attended a Methodist class meeting. I went with a burdened spirit, and happened to sit next a poor, bereaved mother, whose heart was still heavier than mine. The class leader was the town constable a man who bought and sold slaves, who whipped his brethren and sisters of the church at the public whipping post, in jail or out of jail. He was ready to perform that Christian office any where for fifty cents. This white-faced, black-hearted brother came near us, and said to the stricken woman,  Sister, can't you tell us how the Lord deals with your soul? Do you love him as you did formerly?            She rose to her feet, and said, in piteous tones,  My Lord and Master, help me! My load is more than I can bear. God has hid himself from me, and I am left in darkness and misery.  Then, striking her breast, she continued,  I can't tell you what is in here! They've got all my children. Last week they took the last one. God only knows where they've sold her. They let me have her sixteen years, and then O! O! Pray for her brothers and sisters!           I've got nothing to live for now. God make my time short!            She sat down, quivering in every limb. I saw that constable class leader become crimson in the face with suppressed laughter, while he held up his handkerchief, that those who were weeping for the poor woman's calamity might not see his merriment. Then, with assumed gravity, he said to the bereaved mother,  Sister, pray to the Lord that every dispensation of his divine will may be sanctified to the good of your poor needy soul!            The congregation struck up a hymn, and sung as though they were as free as the birds that warbled round us,     Ole Satan thought he had a mighty aim;   He took my sins upon his back;   Ole Satan's church is here below.              Precious are such moments to the poor slaves. If you were to hear them at such times, you might think they were happy. But can that hour of singing and shouting sustain them through the dreary week, toiling without wages, under constant dread of the lash?           The Episcopal clergyman, who, ever since my earliest recollection, had been a sort of god among the slaveholders, concluded, as his family was large, that he must go where money was more abundant. A      
      (pointing to Hilton Head), an' shut yourself up dar; dat fort dat Sesh Buckner said de debil couldn't take, but Deff 'll fin' you dar. All your frien's may forget you, but Deff 'll nebber forget you. Now, my bredren, prepare to lie ded-a-de-dah!              This was the burden of a very long sermon, after which the whole congregation went round in a sort of solemn dance, called the  spiritual shuffle,  shaking hands with each other, and calling each other by name as they sang:                      Harriet's account of her interview with an old negro she met at Hilton Head, is amusing and interesting. He said  I'd been yere seventy-three years, workin' for my master widout even a     
    cabbage, the next dearest thing to a colored man, in the South, is his religion. I call it a  thing,  because they always speak of getting religion as if they were going to market for it.             You better go an' get religion, dat's what you better do, fer de devil will be arter you one of dees days, and den whar will yer be?  said an elderly Sister, who was on her way to the  Revival,  at St. Paul's, in Nashville, last winter. The man to whom she addressed these words of advice stopped, raised his hat, and replied:             Anty, I ain't quite ready to-night, but I em gwine to get it before the meetins close, kase when that getting-up day comes, I want to have the witness; that I do.              Yes, yer better, fer ef yer don't dar'll be a mighty stir 'mong de brimstone down dar, dat dey will, fer yer's bin bad nuff; I knows yer fum A to izzard,  returned the old lady.            The church was already well filled, and the minister had taken his text. As the speaker warmed up in his subject, the Sisters began to swing their heads and reel to and fro, and eventually began a shout. Soon, five or six were fairly at it, which threw the house into a buzz. Seats were soon vacated near the shouters, to give them more room, because the women did not wish to have their hats smashed in by the frenzied Sisters. As a woman sprung up in her sent, throwing up her long arms, with a loud scream, the lady on the adjoining seat quickly left, and did not stop till she got to a safe distance.                     Ah, ha!  exclaimed a woman near by,  'fraid of your new bonnet! Ain't got much religion, I reckon. Specks you'll have to come out of that if you want to save your soul.              She thinks more of that hat now, than she does of a seat in heaven,  said another.             Never mind,  said a third,  when she gets de witness, she'll drap dat hat an' shout herself out of breath.             The shouting now became general; a dozen or more entering into it most heartily. These demonstrations increased or abated, according to movements of the leaders, who were in and about the pulpit; for the minister had closed his discourse, and first one, and then another would engage in prayer. The meeting was kept up till a late hour, during which, four or five sisters becoming exhausted, had fallen upon the floor and lay there, or had been removed by their friends.            St. Paul is a fine structure, with its spire bathed in the clouds, and standing on the rising land in South Cherry Street, it is a building that the citizens may well be proud of.            In the evening I went to the First Baptist Church, in Spruce Street. This house is equal in size and finish to St. Paul. A large assembly was in attendance, and a young man from Cincinnati was introduced by the pastor as the preacher for the time being. He evidently felt that to set a congregation to shouting, was the highest point to be attained, and he was equal to the occasion. Failing to raise a          good shout by a reasonable amount of exertion, he took from his pocket a letter, opened it, held it up and began,  When you reach the other world you'll be hunting for your mother, and the angel will read from this paper. Yes, the angel will read from this paper.             For fully ten minutes the preacher walked the pulpit, repeating in a loud, incoherent manner,  And the angel will read from this letter.  This created the wildest excitement, and not less than ten or fifteen were shouting in different parts of the house, while four or five were going from seat to seat shaking hands with the occupants of the pews.  Let dat angel come right down now an' read dat letter,  shouted a Sister, at the top of her voice. This was the signal for loud exclamations from various parts of the house.  Yes, yes, I want's to hear the letter.   Come, Jesus, come, or send an angel to read the letter.   Lord, send us the power.  And other remarks filled the house. The pastor highly complimented the effort, as one of  great power,  which the audience most cordially endorsed. At the close of the service the strange minister had hearty shakes of the hand from a large number of leading men and women of the church. And this was one of the most refined congregations in Nashville.            It will be difficult to erase from the mind of the negro of the South, the prevailing idea that outward demonstrations, such as, shouting, the loud  amen,  and the most boisterous noise in prayer, are not necessary adjuncts to piety.                    A young lady of good education and refinement, residing in East Tennessee, told me that she had joined the church about a year previous, and not until she had one shouting spell, did most of her Sisters believe that she had  the Witness.              And did you really shout?  I inquired.             Yes. I did it to stop their mouths, for at nearly every meeting, one or more would say, 'Sister Smith, I hope to live to see you show that you've got the Witness, for where the grace of God is, there will be shouting, and the sooner you comes to that point the better it will be for you in the world to come.'              To get religion, join a benevolent society that will pay them  sick dues  when they are ill, and to bury them when they die, appears to be the beginning, the aim, and the end of the desires of the colored people of the South. In Petersburg I was informed that there were thirty-two different secret societies in that city, and I met persons who held membership in four at the same time. While such associations are of great benefit to the improvident, they are, upon the whole, very injurious. They take away all stimulus to secure homes and to provide for the future.            As a man observed to me,  I b'longs ter four s'ieties, de 'Samaritans,' de 'Gallalean Fisherman,' de 'Sons of Moses,' an' de 'Wise Men of de East.' All of dees pays me two dollars a week when I is sick, an' twenty-five dollars ter bury me when I dies. Now ain't dat good?             I replied that I thought it would be far better, if he put his money in a home and educated himself.         
               After supper the room was cleared and made ready for the dance. If some slave could be found who had an old fiddle and could play it at all, he was called on to furnish music; if not, some one would take an old tin pan and use it like a tambourine. Two or three others  pat Jubo,  that is, would keep time by patting their knees with their hands, and to this primitive music the dance would go on hour after hour till nearly, if not quite, broad daylight. This would, however, be more or less singing of words that were often made on the spot.      I love my darlin', dat I do;       These words would be sung over and over ago.        Sally's in de garden siftin' sand,               Some slaves were good dancers, especially the young girls, some of whom could dance so steadily that if a glass of water were placed on their heads none of the water would be spilt. I have often seen a girl dance for ten minutes with a glass cup filled with water on her head without any of it being spilt.             If the next day was Sunday or was a holiday, the dance would  contiuue  all night. The young men would dance all night till broad daylight, and then go home with the girls in the morning.             In some other cabin, perhaps on the same plantation, while the young people were dancing, the old ones would be holding a prayer  meetin' , notice having been sent out as in the case of the dance. As none of the slaves could read, there were no books at these meetings. When the folks got together some one would begin with a prayer, or           perhaps with a hymn, in which he or she would be followed by all in the room, unless it happened that they did not know the piece, which was perhaps being made up as the singer went along.             Of course there were no musical conductors, but the slaves in part made up for this lack by keeping time with their feet and hands. These meetings would sometimes last all night, and the slaves, ignorant as they were, always enjoyed them.             The following hymn was one of the most popular, and was sure to be sung at these meetings:       Roll Jordan roll, roll Jordan roll,               As I have said before, slaves were very musical in their way, which, if not up to the modern ideas of music, was such that they derived very much enjoyment from it. At nearly all times one would hear the slaves singing snatches of old plantation songs, which for want of space I cannot print, but the following is a part of one of the best known songs:        When I was a little pickanninny, playin' around de cabin door,                           I was de happiest little darkey in de land,

Should a pass not be granted, the slave lies down, and sleeps for the day--the only way to drown his sorrow and disappointment.             Others of the slaves, who do not belong to the church, spend their Sabbath in playing with marbles, and other games, for each other's food,  c.            Some occupy the time in dancing to the music of a banjo, made out of a large gourd. This is continued till the after part of the day, when they separate, and gather wood for their log-cabin fires the ensuing week.

The slave forgets all his sufferings, except to remind others of the trials during the past week, exclaiming:  Thank God, I shall not live here always!  Then they pass from one to another, shaking hands, and bidding each other farewell, promising, should they meet no more on earth, to strive and meet in heaven, where all is joy, happiness and liberty. As they separate, they sing a parting hymn of praise.             Sometimes the slaves meet in an old log-cabin, when they find it necessary to keep a watch.

In some places, if the slaves are caught praying to God, they are whipped more than if they had committed a great crime. The slaveholders will allow the slaves to dance, but do not want them to pray to God. Sometimes, when a     
     a greater part of the distance fast asleep; I knew the road pretty well. There used to be a great many run-aways in that section, and they would hide away in the woods and swamps, and if they found a person alone as I was, they would spring out at them and rob them. As this thought came into my head during my lonely walk, thinks I, it won't do for me to go to sleep, and I began to look about me for some weapon of defence; I took my jackknife from my pocket and opened it; now I am ready to stab the first one that tackles me, I said; but try as I would, I commenced to nod, nod, till I was fast asleep again. The long walk and the exertion of carrying on the meeting had nearly used me up.             The way in which we worshiped is almost indescribable. The singing was accompanied by a certain ecstasy of motion, clapping of hands, tossing of heads, which would continue without cessation about half an hour; one would lead off in a kind of recitative style, others joining in the chorus. The old house partook of the ecstasy; it rang with their jubilant shouts, and shook in all its joints. It is not to be wondered at that I fell asleep, for when I awoke I found I had lost my knife, and the fact that I would now have to depend on my own muscle, kept me awake till I had reached the neighborhood of my home. There was a lane about half a mile from the house, on each side of which was a ditch to drain the road, and was nearly half full of water; as I neared this lane I fell asleep again, as the first thing I knew I was in the ditch; I had walked right off into it, best clothes and all. Such a paddling to get out you never saw. I was wide

And this was one of the most refined congregations in Nashville.            It will be difficult to erase from the mind of the negro of the South, the prevailing idea that outward demonstrations, such as, shouting, the loud  amen,  and the most boisterous noise in prayer, are not necessary adjuncts to piety.                    A young lady of good education and refinement, residing in East Tennessee, told me that she had joined the church about a year previous, and not until she had one shouting spell, did most of her Sisters believe that she had  the Witness.              And did you really shout?  I inquired.             Yes. I did it to stop their mouths, for at nearly every meeting, one or more would say, 'Sister Smith, I hope to live to see you show that you've got the Witness, for where the grace of God is, there will be shouting, and the sooner you comes to that point the better it will be for you in the world to come.'              To get religion, join a benevolent society that will pay them  sick dues  when they are ill, and to bury them when they die, appears to be the beginning, the aim, and the end of the desires of the colored people of the South. In Petersburg I was informed that there were thirty-two different secret societies in that city, and I met persons who held membership in four at the same time. While such associations are of great benefit to the improvident, they are, upon the whole, very injurious. They take away all stimulus to secure homes and to provide for the future.            As a man observed to me,  I b'longs ter four s'ieties, de 'Samaritans,' de 'Gallalean Fisherman,' de 'Sons of Moses,' an' de 'Wise Men of de East.' All of dees pays me two dollars a week when I is sick, an' twenty-five dollars ter bury me when I dies. Now ain't dat good?             I replied that I thought it would be far better, if he put his money in a home and educated himself.         
       Sukey Bat Moore on the Art of Flying.             One summer night about twelve o'clock my mother was awakened by Sukey (who had just  returned from a  revival ) kneeling at her bedside, saying,  Mistis, Mistis, pray for me,--Judy Freeman has got religion and I can't git it.  My mother tried to soothe, and promised to pray for  her. Later on she gave evidence of having  come through.  Not long afterward while in church she felt happy, and began to shout, saying,  Oh! I feel I can fly to heaven!  Some of the sisters said to her,  Aunt Sukey, do try,  and under the influence of excitement she really did jump out of the window, and of course fell to the ground; fortunately it was very low and she sustained no injury. One of her friends asked her why she failed to fly. She replied,  I dunno, honey, 'cept as how I didn't git de  right flop  !

      charm. They would come forth as spontaneously as if they were the natural outflow of his soul, as if they were specimens of the rich quarry within, or as if God would thus show what can be wrought in a heart that gives him entire dominion.             One day while he was at work in his garden, singing and shouting, I said:  You seem happy to-day.               Yes, massa, I'se jus tinking.               ' What are you thinking of?               Oh I'se jus tinking;  (and then his emotions prevented utterance.)  I'se jus tinking dat ef de crumbs dat fall from de Master's table, in dis world, am so good, wat will de GREAT LOAF in glory be! I tells ye, massa, dar will be nuff an' to spare dare.              At another time when he seemed very happy and I had heard him shout,  Lord Jesus, will dere be one for me?  I said,  You are having a good time to-day, uncle?  He answered:              O massa, I was meditatin' about Jesus bein'  de Carpenter ; an' so he can make mansions for his people in glory.  And then with uplifted face and with tears he cried out,  O Jesus, will dar be one for me?            Once I said to him,  Uncle Johnson, why don't you go to church once in awhile?  He answered,  Massa, I wants to be dere, but I can't ' have .               You can't  behave ?               Well, massa, you knows, late years, de flesh be weak; an' when dey 'gins to talk and sing about Jesus I 'gins to fill up, and putty soon I has to holler, and den dey say, 'Carry dat man to de door, he 'sturb de meetin'.               But you should hold in until you get home.               O massa, I can't hold in--I  bust  if I don't holler.              Once, after hearing him pray and sing at midnight while a thunder-storm was passing, in the morning I said,  Was that you shouting so last night?               Yes, massa, I 'spose.               Well, I thought the thunder made noise enough without your hallooing.              He looked up, and with astonishment said:  Massa, do you tink I'se goin' to lie dere on my bed like a great pig, wen de Lord com'd along shakin' de earth and de heavens? No, massa, when I hears de thun'er coming, I says, 'Ellen, Ellen, wake up here,  we's goin' to hear from home ag'in .'        
      on Tuesday morning--this was Sunday night. His house was five  miles off.             Readers, just notice what I suffered as a man, and yet these trials were good for me. Col. Jones made me suffer, in his life-time, what few man have suffered. On one occasion, I submitted to let him tie and whip me. I asked him if he didn't think be he had whipped me enough.              When I am done with you it will be night,  he replied.             I did not know my strength; I flung my foot against the tree and broke loose and got away from him and the other white man, untied the knot with my teeth. I was tempted to kill him.             This was two years before I parted with him for good. There was a day when he would take no money for me. The first time he ever talked of selling me was when I asked him to let me have a wife on Dr. Roger's plantation. He never let me see any peace after the first four years.              Bretheren,  what a blessing it is to dwell together in the spirit. Beware how you entertain a stranger, for you may entertain an angel. Have you forgotten the life we lived when we were slaves? Our sufferings were great, and in some places we were not allowed to worship God at all. We had to have secret prayer meetings on Saturday nights, and some would have to watch for the patrolmen and hard task-masters, to keep from being surprised, while the others prayed and sung. When the enemy was seen the watch would give the alarm; we would then close the meeting and make our escape, in order to keep our backs from being slashed and salted down.             In Marsh county, N. C., we had a noble speaker by the name of Minger Crudemp; he was the slave of a popular Baptist Minister, who, although he was a preacher, did not allow his slaves to worship the God he praised. This Minger Crudemp would hold prayer-meetings every Saturday night that he had a chance in spite of the penalty he would have to pay if he was caught; they would run him Saturday and Sunday.  Bretheren , see how hard it was for us so serve God in the days of slavery. In some places they were allowed to praise God, but they had to have a white man to watch them. (When I was a small boy Bethey Thompson, a religious woman, was whipped by her mistress because she would pray and shout through the day.) Oh, how hard were the lives we led in those days. It was a common thing for slave men and women to run away into the woods to keep their masters from whipping them. To day,  bretheren , we ought to love one another and be the best friends and citizens in America. Just look at the mercy of God in the midst of all the Presidents during slavery; yet we were held in bondage. God reared up Abraham Lincoln--one whom the people had not looked for--who used more power than any of the men in America. He caused the  shackels  to be thrown off the bondmen.             There are few of you who have ever thought what it cost to set you free--hundreds and thousands of lives were lost; even our greatest man, Abraham Lincoln, fell. No other man did the will of God as he did; it seemed as if he was intended to liberate us. He arose           and declared that slavery should be  be  abolished. This was power that God gave him. His heart failed him, but God pressed  him on. All that we can do is to live close to the cross as a race. Life and blood was sacrificed for us; our people are gaining on one hand but losing on the other. Freedom of speech, to serve God, and to worship under our own vine and fig-tree, is ours.             Between sixty and seventy years ago the colored people of the South were shouting in the fields, when the overseer came and was about to whip them and drive them to work, when he was stricken down and converted by the power of God; then out came the master, and he was also converted. These I relate to show the power of God and the salvation of men and their souls.             How often have mortals been whipped to death and no one near to help or pity them. How horrible for a man to stand and sea his wife whipped and her wounds bathed in salt water, and not be able to protect her. To-day, some of our race are not doing much better. Man and wife, think of the passage in the great book;  Little children, love ye one another, as the scripture hath commanded you to do.       FRIDAY JONES.  Raleigh, N. C.

      you to go to the gin-house, and get Ann Eliza, and give her one good whipping. I have whipped her myself till I am tired, but it does no good. She needs bringing down, for she is the torment of my life. Lay it on well; you needn't be afraid. It is a good time now, as Mr. McKiernan is away from home. He is mighty careful of the pretty girl, himself, and that is what makes her so impudent.               Yes, ma'am,  replied Anderson,  I'll give her a lesson she'll remember;  and he departed to the gin-house.             Ann Eliza saw him coming, and she knew her doom. She cast one imploring look at her husband, who was working at her side. Edward returned it with a glance so full of terror, pity, and an intense longing to avenge her wrongs, that all her powers were roused, and she felt strong to endure the worst.             She stood calmly by her husband's side, while, with his rope, the ruffian bound her hands; and then, at his command, she followed him towards the house, leaving poor Edward gazing after her in silent terror. One moment a flash of vengeance gleamed from his dark eyes; and then he realized his utter helplessness, and his head drooped low, while great tears fell upon the heap of cotton.             Peter stood in the shelter of one of the out-buildings, and watched Anderson as he led his victim to the orchard. There he  staked her out  upon the ground, and, with a zest unknown to  uncultivated natures , he applied the cowhide to her naked back and limbs. Her screams of agony only excited his demoniac mirth.  That's right,  he cried,  I like to hear you shout;           that's the way ye all shout at the camp-ground. Shout away! you're gittin' happy now.              He beat her there, mockin' the while her cries of pain, till she became too much exhausted to utter another sound; and then, untying her, he delivered her to her mistress.  Thar, ma'am,  said he,  she ain't got use for no more this time. She's got the devil in her, but I reckon he'll keep still till she gits over this ere.              Much religious excitement existed at this time among the slaves in the neighborhood, and particularly upon the plantation of Mr. McKiernan. An old Baptist preacher, named Archie Eggleston, had been hired here the preceding year; and he had zealously preached to his brethren in bonds the love and compassion of Jesus; and had sought, in his simple way, to encourage them to hope for a home among  the spirits bright.  His language, it is true, was full of the quaint idioms of his race; but it spoke to the hearts of his unlearned auditory; for the little which he could tell them of the blessed Saviour was just what they loved to hear. They  received the word with gladness,  and, with its warm and cheering rays, it illumined their darkness, and strewed the thorny path they trod, not with the roses of content, but with the trembling violets of hope.             Sweet, when their daily toil was done, was the hour which, borrowed from their needed rest, they spent alone in prayer; and, as the breath of their humble souls ascended on the soft air of evening, their trusting hearts were filled with heavenly consolations.      
     a greater part of the distance fast asleep; I knew the road pretty well. There used to be a great many run-aways in that section, and they would hide away in the woods and swamps, and if they found a person alone as I was, they would spring out at them and rob them. As this thought came into my head during my lonely walk, thinks I, it won't do for me to go to sleep, and I began to look about me for some weapon of defence; I took my jackknife from my pocket and opened it; now I am ready to stab the first one that tackles me, I said; but try as I would, I commenced to nod, nod, till I was fast asleep again. The long walk and the exertion of carrying on the meeting had nearly used me up.             The way in which we worshiped is almost indescribable. The singing was accompanied by a certain ecstasy of motion, clapping of hands, tossing of heads, which would continue without cessation about half an hour; one would lead off in a kind of recitative style, others joining in the chorus. The old house partook of the ecstasy; it rang with their jubilant shouts, and shook in all its joints. It is not to be wondered at that I fell asleep, for when I awoke I found I had lost my knife, and the fact that I would now have to depend on my own muscle, kept me awake till I had reached the neighborhood of my home. There was a lane about half a mile from the house, on each side of which was a ditch to drain the road, and was nearly half full of water; as I neared this lane I fell asleep again, as the first thing I knew I was in the ditch; I had walked right off into it, best clothes and all. Such a paddling to get out you never saw. I was wide
